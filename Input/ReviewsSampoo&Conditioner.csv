AV1YmBrdGV-KLJ3adewb,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Curling Irons & Wands,Daily Shampoo,Shampoo Plus Conditioner,Beauty,Color Additives & Fillers","I like the color protection part, however my hair feels weighed down after using. Prefer the volume shampoo for fine hair."
AV1YmBrdGV-KLJ3adewb,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Curling Irons & Wands,Daily Shampoo,Shampoo Plus Conditioner,Beauty,Color Additives & Fillers",I like this improved version better than the old one which I didn't like at all. My hair feels very soft and appears a little fuller. The scent is pleasant - different than old version but is an improvement as well.
AV1YmBrdGV-KLJ3adewb,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Curling Irons & Wands,Daily Shampoo,Shampoo Plus Conditioner,Beauty,Color Additives & Fillers",I recently got my hair dyed after many years of going without . Pantene was my shampoo of choice after gettibg my hair done. It has retained its luster for weeks since I got my new look. I will stay loyal to pantene products after seeing its results.
AV1YmBrdGV-KLJ3adewb,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Curling Irons & Wands,Daily Shampoo,Shampoo Plus Conditioner,Beauty,Color Additives & Fillers",This product is good and I am happy with it. I will use it again and would recommend it to others.

AV1YmBrdGV-KLJ3adewb,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Curling Irons & Wands,Daily Shampoo,Shampoo Plus Conditioner,Beauty,Color Additives & Fillers","I love almost ALL your shampoos but this is my favorite. It delivers clean hair, shine, weightless conditioning, and a very clean fragrance. The lather is amazing and it rinses clean even in hard water. I love the Classic Clean and the other color safe formula for shine. LOVE!"
AV1YmBrdGV-KLJ3adewb,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Curling Irons & Wands,Daily Shampoo,Shampoo Plus Conditioner,Beauty,Color Additives & Fillers","I received a sample of both the shampoo and conditioner and was very impressed. I bought them right away and have only been using these two products together for less than one week and I love them! My long hair feels so soft, is shiny, and not weighed down."
AV1YmBrdGV-KLJ3adewb,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Curling Irons & Wands,Daily Shampoo,Shampoo Plus Conditioner,Beauty,Color Additives & Fillers",Most shampoos and conditioners for colored hair are so heavy that my hair just fell flat. With this new Pantene my color isn't fading and I have all day volume. Add the super reasonable price and I am one happy girl!
AV1YmBrdGV-KLJ3adewb,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Curling Irons & Wands,Daily Shampoo,Shampoo Plus Conditioner,Beauty,Color Additives & Fillers",One of my favorite Pantene products.

AV1YmBrdGV-KLJ3adewb,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Curling Irons & Wands,Daily Shampoo,Shampoo Plus Conditioner,Beauty,Color Additives & Fillers","I decided to try color preserve when my color was fading. My color lasted longer and I like the smooth, silkiness of the shampoo."
AV1YmBrdGV-KLJ3adewb,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Curling Irons & Wands,Daily Shampoo,Shampoo Plus Conditioner,Beauty,Color Additives & Fillers","love the way my color lasted, shined had more volume than usual after I used Color Preserve Volume Shampoo."

AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I have very oily, fine hair and this shampoo just made my hair look dirtier than before washing it. My hair was greasy and heavy. I thought maybe I just didn't rinse well enough so I gave it another try a few days later but had the same results. I can say that it smelled good!"
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",I've used your volume product for years but all of the sudden you removed the 2-in-1 so I switched to this and the conditioner then you changed the shampoo and the conditioner (which wasn't nearly as good as the 2-in-1 but was better than nothing) ! I loved your product but now I have to find another unfortunately nothing you offer compares to the quality you used to have! Why would you change such a great product! I wish you'd bring back the 2-in-1! For me being a man with baby fine hair it was the only product on the market that didn't cause me to lose hair or dry it out and didn't have an over powering feminine scent! I really wish you'd stop messing with good things!
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",I have been using aussome volume for over 10 years except it used to be called real volume. I would really like to know if you changed the formula for it. The last 6 or so months I've been having scalp problems with sores and my hair falling out. The last couple of bottles I purchased have had a much stronger smell to it and it is drying my hair and scalp out really bad. It never used to do this. It always made my hair really thicker looking and just really nice. Hardly ever had to use conditioner. Please if you could let me know about that I would really appreciate it. I haven't ever thought about switching from Aussie but now I think I have too.
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","i tried this hoping it would give great results. it was the opposite effect. my hair became limp, flat, and greasy not to mention it felt grimy and dirty. i usually like these products but was diappointed. sorry aussie:("
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",IT LEAVES MY HAIR AND SCALP DRIED OUT. IT DOES PROVIDE ANY VOLUME.
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","You changed the smell! The bottle I just used up says the scent is white ginger, the new one says it's jojoba, but it smells like cherries or something. Why in the world have you changed the formula! I've used this for over 10 years, and the smell was always the same, even if the formula was changed. I miss the old smell, it was my favorite. Now I have to find another shampoo with a mild scent that I like. Rude."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","The scent is too strong, it burns your eyes, and leaves your hair very dry. Avoid it. When it comes to shampoo and conditioner you really get what you pay for."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I received this as a sample from influenster. First, let me say I love the smell. It is fresh and fruity and very good. However, when I was rinsing it out, it took all the 'slip' out of my hair and my hair felt pure straw!!! I am sad, because I loved the smell."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I use this because it has very little fragrance, but the containers are pure torture to use. You can barely open and close them, so I have to put it in another bottle."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I received this product free for testing purposes, but my opinions are 100 my own. I didn't fall in love with this shampoo. I think it dried out my hair. Once I rinsed it out, I instantly felt like I needed a lot of conditioner to make up for the dryness. I think there are better shampoos at the drugstore, but I didn't hate it."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",This shampoo smells great and does a good job at cleaning my hair. I've been using this product for about 2-3 weeks. However I do not notice a difference in the volume of my hair. I have thick coarse hair which is hard to hold any volume even with teasing. If you have less coarse hair this might work better for you. I used this with their volumizing conditioner and spray and did not see a difference. I received this product for free but all opinions are my own
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",I do not feel like I had more volume after using this. Which is the whole point right I also could not stand the smell. That is just preference of course. But I was self conscious about it. Don't get me wrong it's not a bad shampoo but I didn't see a difference in volume. It did not make my hair worse. I did recieve this shampoo for free for testing purposes but all opinions are my own.
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I was very disappointed with this shampoo. It didnt give me any volume. In fact it made my hair oily and flat. I lile aussir products but this one just doesn't hold up. I tested Aussie for free, but all opinions are my own."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I use this because it has very little fragrance, but the containers are pure torture to use. You can barely open and close them, so I have to put it in another bottle."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","Makes my hair clean, soft, and smooth without weighing it down! Touchable volume and silky finish. It also smells so good. I was sent this product for reviewing purposes but all opinions are my own."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",I thought this shampoo was great it felt good in my hair it didn't dry my hair out or make it overly oily. however the smell was a little strong for me it did smell good just alittle strong that's my only dislike. However if smell really doesn't bother you then you'll love this shampoo. I was given this product to try and review by influencer. However my opinion of the product is my own.
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I received this item for free and in my opinion I would love to use this product everyday! It is wonderful, the shampoo lathers really well and has a light citrusy scent. The conditioner is not greasy and I did notice that after a week of daily use that my hair does seem much thicker then usual! I would definitely buy this again."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I love this shampoo so much! It leaves my hair feeling extra soft and lightweight! I do not see a difference with the volume in my hair after using this - that's why I gave this product 4 out of 5. Otherwise, I absolutely love this product so much and will repurchase! *I received this product via Influenster to try for free review"
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","This product is pretty good, but it's not really right for me. It doesn't make my hair as smooth as some other products I use, but that doesn't mean it couldn't do that for yours. It'd like it to provide a little more volume for what it's advertising. I tested this product for free, but all opinions are my own."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","My initial reaction was that the bottle was very hard to open and that the scent was not all that great. However, after using it, I loved the way it made my hair feel. It felt soft and the difference in volume from my regular shampoo was noticeable. I received this product for free. Opinions are my own."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","So, i like this product because it tends to make my hair a little more dry and for me that is good up top because my hair gets very greasy very quickly. However because of this my hair gets more tangled than usual."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I love this shampoo. I have extremely thick hair but this shampoo lathers up nicely and I an use less than I normally would. It doesn't weigh my hair down like other shampoos either. Like all Aussie products, the smell is fantastic and lasts all day. I tried Aussie for free but these are my own opinions"
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",I loved this shampoo. Ive always loved aussie especially the smell of it. This shampoo is light i have thin staright hair and in always worried anything that promises volume will weigh it down but it left my hair bouncy and soft. I got this product for free but will purchase once i run out because i loved it
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I was given this product to rest for free from Influenster but alll opinions are my own. I liked this shampoo for the value and smell, but I didn't find it particularly volumizing. I have fairly flat hair so it takes a lot to work volume on me."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","Light, refreshing, and foamy - this shampoo really does a great job cleaning hair without leaving it heavy or stripped. Lots of foam, and lots of volume! I didn't like the packaging, but I did like the shampoo. I received this to review - but my opinions are my own"
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I'm a fan of this shampoo. The fragrance wasn't overpowering and the thickness of it was good quality. A little of it goes a long way. I have very long way so this is a huge factor for me. It washed very well. As for added volume, there was some slight addition after a couple washes along with the conditioner. I did however, feel like the shampoo stripped a lot of the (good) oils from my hair and it felt dry before conditioning. So I needed to add extra to put the moisture back in. I received this product to review, but the review is completely my own."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","My boyfriend and I have both been using this shampoo and we both love it. He has thick hair and doesn't really need to use it at all, but I have really thin hair that tends to just sit flat on my head, especially at the roots. This shampoo smells wonderful and gives me volume all day long. I use it second in my routine....condition first, then shampoo. The ONLY con I have found with it is that it makes my hair stick together when I rinse it out and super hard to brush. Other than that, love it. Disclaimer: I tested this Aussie product for free, but all opinions are my own."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I loved the smell and usually really enjoy Aussie products. My hair is dyed and it did seem to strip the color quickly so I'd prefer a more color friendly option. As far as the volume, I saw no difference in this shampoo and any other shampoo I've ever used. Combined with other products or worked nicely. I received this product for free to review in exchange for my opinions."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I am absolutely in love with this Aussie Aussome shampoo. I have been using it for a little over a week and my hair is visibly shinier, and smooth to the point where I can run my fingers through it and there isn't a single tangle.This leaves my hair feeling really clean, but also really smooth and shiny. This is also a pretty good deal. I recommend using it with the Aussome Conditioner. I received this product for free to review from influenster for testing purposes."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","This shampoo made my hair super soft and smooth, and did give it volume. Plus, it smells great! A little bit goes a long way. It's super sudsy, which leads me to the downside. It contains sulfates, and I try to stay away from shampoos containing sulfates. I guess the other thing that was a con was that it's a bit difficult to open the lid when you're in the shower. It can be a bit hard to open. (Disclaimer: I tested Aussie for free, but all opinions are my own.)"
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I really liked this shampoo, it smells great and it added a little bit of extra volume to my hair. There's only one problem - the shampoo bottle is hard to open. Disclaimer: I received this product for free in an Aussie VoxBox from influenster, but all my opinions are my own."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",This shampoo feels very lathering on the hair. It really foams up so a little goes a long way. My hair feels clean right after I use it. It has a very fruity smell and the closest that I can compare it to is skittles. The only thing is that this precept doesn't give me the volume that I am looking for or that I was expecting. I will be using other Aussie products just not this one in particular. I did try this product for free but all opinions are my own.
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",The product is great. Cleans and adds volume to hair without weighing it down.
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",Enjoyed it
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",what is the fragrance is it lavender smells like it but ingredients don't say thanks
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","My husband, two year old daughter and I all used this shampoo and conditioner with no complaints. Left my hair feeling soft and clean. I tested Aussie for free, but all opinions are my own."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",Loved this shampoo! It's lathering and smells great! It's perfect for limp or flat hair and really helps boost up the volume when used more and more. Thanks Aussie!!!
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",I really like this shampoo! It smelled great and seemed to really work with my hair! But if you are looking for moisture this is not for you.
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","Lathers well, smells great, cleans thoroughly, inexpensive, removes buildup. Highly recommend. I think it's more of a clarifying shampoo, which I love because nothing makes hair meaner than leftover styling products. I also think, quite frankly, the little kangaroo on the bottle is adorable, not that I only use shampoo endorsed by marsupials. Cheers."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I had to take off one star because of the bottle design for the 13.5oz bottle. Though it is unique, the cap is very tight and super hard to open - I thought it was just me, but upon asking my friends and family that also use this product, they, too, agreed that the cap is too tight and difficult to open. (Especially if you have nails - be super careful, as I have already broken two nails opening this product). It's a shame because the product itself is wonderful - smells great, works great, delivers perfect oomph and volume to your hair, leaves it wonderfully lightly scented, decent price, and is an overall great product. I ended up simply prying the cap open before I go to use the shampoo/conditioner, and pouring it into an empty bottle from another shampoo brand. I would love if a new cap design/technology was looked into for a smoother, easier opening!"
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I love this shampoo so much! It leaves my hair feeling extra soft and lightweight!

AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I have used this product (along with the aussome volume conditioner and hairspray) for the past 2 weeks, and I love it! I have gotten so many compliments on the shine and volume of my hair since I have used this product! It's a great price and a great set to use if volume and shine are what you're looking for. I will definitely be purchasing this product again in the future! While I did receive this product for free to test, all of these opinions are my own."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I am a huge fan of this shampoo.

This shampoo has been great for me. It smells so delicious!!! It doesn't dry my hair and leave it knotty like other shampoos. After showering my hair absolutely feels nice and does have a little volume.
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I love the smell of this Aussie shampoo. It gets my hair very clean without drying it out. I love how soft my hair feels after using this. I have fine hair, and i did notice a bit of volume after using this shampoo. I received this Aussie product for free in an Influenster Voxbox for testing purposes. My opinions are completely my own! :)"
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I use this shampoo once every other day in the shower.

AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",I was very impressed with the clean feeling this shampoo gave my hair after using it.

AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",I love the smell of this shampoo.

AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",Very pleased with this product! I paired this with the Aussie Volume Conditioner.

AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I love having big, bouncy, full of volume hair, especially when I curl it.

AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","As a mom of a tiny hurricane toddler, washing my hair comes lucky enough if I can do it twice a week. My old shampoos by that point have left my hair feeling greasy and not good. I tried the Aussie Volume Shampoo, not only does it smell amazing it hasn't made my hair feel gross. The bottle is a little hard to open but I'm okay with that, or else tiny human will pour it everywhere. I did notice volume when I've left my hair down or the extra oomph to my mom bun. I received this product for free but the opinions are my own. And this brand will be replacing my old go to."
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo",I want to start off by saying that i did recieve this aussie volume shampoo free for my review and honest feedback. I really am in love with the amazing clean smell that this shampoo has. I have always been a huge fan of aussie products for this reason but also for the quality and great results that i get when using. I recieved the volume shampoo and it really does work. I like how it doesnt leave my hair greasy and lifeless like most other hair brands and it gives me that extra boost of volume i need. I would recommend to anyone looking for that extra volume and that smell good hair all day long.
AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I bought this shampoo yesterday and tried it for the first time. I like the scent, and love how my hair looks! It is noticeably fuller and has lift at the crown. Much more volume than with other more expensive shampoos. So happy I found it. I have highlighted and lowlighted hair and it makes it nicely full but not coarse. Thank you for a great product!"

I have been using the shampoo for about a week and I must say that I love how soft it leaves my hair. Not only do I love the softness I also love that it's full of volume. I've tried high and shampooed that claim my hair will be voluminous and I have to say that Aussie is by far my favorite !

I was able to work up a lather really easy and the smell was absolutely amazing. Once I rinsed it out I used the aussie volume conditioner. I dried my hair upside down and the volume was amazing. I have recommended this to friends and family already. I did receive this for free but all opinions are honest and my own."

I decided on this because I wanted basic, thorough cleansing, and that's just what I got! No gunk, no residue good lather, fun fragrance--albeit very fruity in an unidentifiable way. The texture of this shampoo is great too because it's thick without being creamy. I hope you keep this going! I'm very happy right now--and that's saying a lot for someone as picky as me. Thanks Aussie!"

It is sooo rich and makes such a lovely full lather! AND, I swear, it does leave my hair with more volume!!

AV1YmDL9vKc47QAVgr7_,Aussie,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Beauty,Shampoo & Conditioner,Shampoos,Daily Shampoo","I'm kind of sad to see the poor reviews on this product, so I thought I'd write my own. For some reason my hair hates hard water more than most people (we have hard well water, and although the rest of my family noticed their hair was a little less healthy looking, mine looked and felt DISGUSTING because I just could not get the minerals out of my hair, and continuing to wash it only made it worse). This is the only shampoo/conditioner combo that fixed that problem. I had even tried an expensive hard water shampoo that didn't work nearly as well. Even if you don't have hard water issues, this shampoo really made my hair feel lighter and way more voluminous. Everyone's hair is different, but I definitely recommend at least giving this one a try!"

Some hair shampoos does not have a good smell, but this does have the most delicious scent. I also like the volume it gave my hair. I wanted a light volume, so it did the job. The only small complaint I have about the package is that the top is hard to open. I try to keep from breaking my nails every time I try to open it. But other than that I liked it.

AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care",Hi i love this line used since high school. I just bought a new set and it smells different. Should I be concerned or was their a change in suave sleek
AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care",I used to love the sleek and shine shampoo and conditioner but the last few time I bought it it smelled like I was putting developer in my hair ... Super strong smell of chemical I thought maybe I got a bad batch but the last two bottles I've bought have that scent of chemical to it .... Very disappointed
AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care","I was excited to purchase this specific formula from Suave since I've always had problems with frizz and unruly hair. After using it the first time, it left a horrible waxy build up and my hair was dull. I changed the amounts of shampoo and conditioner but hair kept coming out the same. Love the scent but hated the way it left my hair. I'm rather disappointed. :("
AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care",The shampoo did not smell quite as bad as the conditioner. The conditioner smells like tire cleaner. I had a friend smell them and she was disgusted too. The package was in plastic wrap so I could not smell before I purchased. My hair fell out too. Very disappointed.
AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care",I had been using this product off and on for a couple of years and I really loved it. Loved the way it smelled and the way my hair felt. A few months ago I bought it again. This time after the first 2-3 days my scalp became dry and itchy. It was so itchy that I just wanted to scrape my scalp right off. Caused sores on my head that were also very itchy. I began to notice my hairbrush filling up with hair. Was cleaning out every week because my hair was falling out. I thought I had just become allergic to the shampoo and conditioner so I gave it to my daughter. Her and her boyfriend began to use it and their scalps became dry and severely itchy. Suave must have changed the formula. They need to pull this product off the shelves and revamp it. Maybe before selling it again the head honchos should taker it home and use it themselves as well as their families. Then they might be more careful about what they are putting on the shelves for the consumer. Please beware if you use this your head will itch like you have never felt an itch before.
AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care",I bought this product and at first i was content with the product. My hair felt clean and fresh but after a few uses i noticed my scalp getting dry and itchy. When i looked at the roots of my hair i noticed the product was burning my scalp and it was peeling!!!.. i stopped using this product and went back to using head and shoulders which i should have never left to try Suave. My scalp is now healing since i moved back. Never again will i use this product that is too harsh.
AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care","I have to say, Suave Professionals Sleek Conditioner for dry or frizzy was the best conditioner I've ever had. It was super affordable and everyone says I smell nice (which is pretty creepy) But, these past 2 days, I noticed something different. The color was different, it felt different, it smelled different, and it wasn't working anymore. I even thought someone was pranking me. So, I decided to search up the old ingredients and compare it to the current conditioner I have. The formula was different. Who ever is responsible for changing the ingredients, PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK! . I really don't want to find a new conditioner because it's so much work. I will change my review to an positive as long as someone does something about the formula."
AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care","My daughter has soft 3b to 3c curls. This product dried her hair so bad that it matted and it took days of oil treatments to get it back to close to normal. My youngest girl had softer wavy hair and this dried her ends. It split them. After the conditioner was rinsed out her ends looked horrible. I came to suave.com for more info and help getting my money back. But I kept getting directed to the home page. I love most Suave products, but this one was a sure miss for us."
AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care",Bought the sleek shampoo and conditioner. Opened them this evening to wash my daughters hair and it was as though someone has dumped them BOTH out and filled with water! Highly dissatisfied with these products!
AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care","I like the way it smells and my hair feels nice after its blow drie however, my hair feels super waxy and oily after half a day..

AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care","My wife and I have used Suave Professional shampoos and conditioners for many years. We have always really liked how they worked and consider them the best value available when it comes to shampoo and conditioner. However, the Sleek product that is similar to Matrix caused my scalp to break out in severe acne. I didn't realize it was the the shampoo. Nothing I tried helped and it kept getting worse. I finally stumbled on various comments online when I was doing research trying to figure out what was causing my problem that indicated Matrix caused them a similar problem. I immediately changed shampoos and ten days later, my scalp is almost completely clear. Will go back to the other Suave Professional products as their is something in this product that my body reacts to negatively."
AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care",I have been using this product for 2 years! I have always and still do love the feeling of my hair from this product and I've always loved the smell it had always stayed my hair until recently as soon as I get out of the shower the scent is gone.. If they could make the scent a bit stronger to stay into my hair longer that would be amazing but other than that it's a great product! :)
AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care",Really like this line especially to be a store shampoo. It does help the hair with straightness. The conditioner is detangling. I have lots of movement using this line especially followed by a light glaze and flat-ironing.
AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care","I have very, very long hair (about 28 inches worth), and I've always been a little bit of a shampoo snob, but I was in between shampoos and just ran into the drug store to get something and just happened pick this up. I was so impressed by it! After using this shampoo only once, my hair was incredibly smoother and felt stronger! However, there was one really bad thing about this shampoo + conditioner, and it's the conditioner!!! It stinks!! It literally smells like rotten wet dog, it is so atrocious. Luckily the scent doesn't last long after you get out of the shower, but it makes the washing experience feel dirty. The shampoo smells good, but that conditioner...who thought of that scent"
AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care","I used this shampoo and conditioner for a couple of years when my typical brand kept altering their line of products. They worked pretty well and who can complain about a big old bottle of shampoo for less than 3 My hair had gotten really damaged from being permanently straightened and additional heat damage which is the only reason I switched back when they finally seemed to get things together again. Unfortunately I needed something more moisturizing plus I also believe they changed the scent of the shampoo from a mild clean scent to a tropical one which was a turn off for me. But still was very happy with this line, would recommend it for anyone without very damaged hair."

AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care",I switched to Suave Sleek Shampoo Conditioner a few months ago after using Matrix's Smooth Sleek exclusively for the last 10 years. It's been a seamless breakup with Matrix! I'm now a big fan of the Suave product that works just as well as a fraction of the price!
AV1ZT7GLglJLPUi8IQLI,Suave,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Beauty,Salon Hair Care","My hair is naturally straight but with quite a bit of frizz which gets worse during summertime on the East Coast because of the humidity. Plus, with the color treatment that I regularly let my hair suffer from, frizz has always been an issue for me. Of course there are ways to control it, such as by using oils, treatment cream, and even hair spray none of which I'm all that crazy about as often times they irritate my skin as they are applied after a wash and remain on the hair for the rest of the day. Then came the Suave Sleek series.. Not only the consistency of the product feel expensive, the first time I used the shampoo, I didn't even feel the need to use the conditioner as it already felt so smooth. The scent is great, and they really do help with the frizz, a lot. I don't even brush my hair anymore because it feels so great. No tangles, just straight, soft, smooth hair. Really worth trying especially considering the price! Can't beat that. Highly recommended! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Hair looks soft and shiny even after it's dry:) other shampoos(dove,Neutrogena triple moisture, Tressemme worked well in the beginning then my hair would feel like hay and it would feel sticky.Thank you...

This was our first time however, trying Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner. Personally, I was not a fan of this product right from the start. I did not like the scent at all. It has a peculiar medicinal-like smell to it which put me off immediately. Also, I found that these products (both the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo Conditioner) were too rich for my fine hair oily scalp. My hair was left lifeless, with no volume and unmanageable. I make an effort not to wash my colour-treated hair everyday to maintain the colour longer. This certainly is not possible with Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner. By the second day after using the shampoo and conditioner, my hair was greasy, flat and smelled bad. Since this product was not right for me, I decided to pass it on to my husband who reports back to me that he likes Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner and will likely continue buying it.

I chose the Age Defy as the claim stated on the bottle is that it instantly restores youthful vitality. Sounded great, right When I received the bottle I noted that it stated 7 signs of aging hair: (1) breakage (2) split ends (3) frizz (4) unruly greys (5) lackluster colour (6) thin look (7) dryness My hair definitely suffers from breakage and split ends, and there are indeed a few unruly greys...perhaps a little more every day. The other issues weren't really a concern for me, but since it was sent to me for free I figured I'd give it a go. I was intrigued by the bottle. It didn't match it's shampoo sister. Instead of being tall and thin, it was almost conical, with the opening at the bottom. Very smart design as it allows the viscous product to settle down at the spout, and thus render it easier to squeeze out of the bottle. I also liked that the plastic was malleable, making it easy to dispense product. I was surprised that there was only 237mL of product in the condition, compared to the 285mL of shampoo since most folks tend to use more conditioner than shampoo. Like the shampoo, the conditioner has that typical Pantene scent, which I find pleasant and not overwhelming. It has a thick and creamy consistency which spreads easily over the hair strands, and combs through nicely withinthe shower. I always use both shampoo and conditioner so it is difficult to comment on how the conditioner works on its own. I can say that my hair felt silky smooth, which I suspect is due to the presence of silicone in the conditioner. My hair smelled great, but there wasn't any noticeable change. I still had breakage and I still had split ends, and my greys were just as unruly as they had been. All in all, I'm rating this conditioner 3 out of 5 starts. In my mind, it is pretty average. My hair felt smooth, but it became oddly subject to static electricity which I had not experienced prior. Like its shampoo sister, it left my hair smelling pleasant, but I hope most conditioners would do so. I would not go out of my way to pick up another bottle, but I would certainly use it again if it were provided to me. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

If I accidentally used too much, before the end of the day my hair would look greasy and stringy. Applied just to the ends and it left too many tangles to comb out. A full-sized bottle lasted almost an entire month and while I don't have super thick hair, I do have long hair and I wash and condition it daily.

The bottle design is great, and I am able to get every last bit of of it. The new design is definitely a plus. The scent is lovely too. Not over powering, but stays with me throughout the day. I have thin fine hair that falls below my shoulders, and a small dollop covers from root to tip. The coverage is great. Rinsing it out is easy, without the buildup or taking extra time to rinse. My hair feels softer, even when still damp. My brush goes through smoothly without much tugging or struggling required. I do notice I still have some flyaways after drying. It's still soft and supple though, which is nice. I will say, it didn't really meet all of the claims for Age Defy.

But, I'm a little disappointed in the size...if it's a great product, I want it to last! After only two washes, I am starting to see that my hair is slightly less tangled when I brush it out, and my grey's seem to be slightly more manageable. Can't wait to report back after a couple of weeks of use! The only drawback so far, is that the scent of the shampoo differs slightly from the great scent of the conditioner.

It feels hydrating without being too heavy and hasn't left my hair feeling frizzy or dry. On the other end up haven't felt like my hair gets greasy quickly or is weighed down so it seems like a well balanced conditioner.

I have very fine hair so conditioners have always made me nervous. They often leave my hair looking rather limp and dull. Once I tried this (small amount) I was hooked. It's a nice thick consistency that seems to stick on the hair without seeping to the roots and causing that limpness I often found with other products. It rinses out nicely and leaves you with tangle free hair. I love the smell of the conditioner. It is a light fresh scent, nothing overpowering, which was a nice surprise.

I also found my hair to be smoother and softer. The product is also a very nice consistency and has a neutral scent. The only issue I had with this product is that after using it, my hair became greasy much faster than normal and I have had to wash it much more frequently.

The packaging and formula looked and felt professional, like a higher-end salon product.

It comes out of the tube like a rich, creamy moisturizer and smells fantastic. I have been using Pantene products for years, but I have used this conditioner for about two weeks. For starters it is way thicker and more luxurious than other conditioners. Some conditioners are watery and runny. it lathers up really well and then washes out completely without leaving any residue that can weigh hair down. My biggest issues are aging hair, including unruly greys, lackluster dyed hair and dry hair. My hair is also naturally wavy and can get really frizzy, especially in the dry, cold Canadian winters. This conditioner addresses all these issues. My hair is soft and manageable and feels moisturized and well nourished. My scalp is not dry or itchy. My hair has a lot of bounce and movement in it. It is bright and shiny and healthy. It is now more like my 19 year old daughter's hair. I like this product and will continue to use it. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

One thing that stands out in particular is the fact that it tamed my grays. It didn't do anything miraculous, like prevent those suckers from growing in the first place, but it did keep the wiry hairs from sticking up like a beacon of my impending old age. Another surprising quality was that it detailed my hair nicely. A brush would just glide through, even when wet. Finally, as a girl who only washes her hair 2 to 3 times a week, this conditioner kept it from getting too oily too soon. Unfortunately it did dry out my scalp, or perhaps that was the shampoo's fault. I would not repurchase this product as it contains too many ingredients that I can't pronounce, however, I will keep what's left in the bottle and use it once a monthwhen my hair needs extra detangling, or when those nasty gray hairs pop up and need a little taming.

First impressions mean everything! When I opened up my kit I immediately noticed the new sleeker bottle design. The slender black bottle has a no-fuss appeal and a higher end look and feel to it. Next came the scentAMAZING! It has an expensive salon smell, definitely not what I'd expect from a product you can buy at the drugstore. I have very thick long curly hair and finding a shampoo and conditioner that works for me is tough, to say the least. Lately, my hair has been showing the tell-tale signs of aging, dry, brittle, breakage, split ends, pesky gray hairs that pop up and scream 'YOOHOO, LOOK AT ME!' and, of course, dreaded FRIZZ. The biggest issues for me are all of the above so I was excited about trying out a product that claimed to be concocted to tackle all of my hair woes. So lets do it!! I've used this product for a little more than two weeks now and so far I'm thrilled. The shampoo has a thick and lasting lather. I could almost feel my hair getting thicker as I worked the lather through my hair. I was anxious to see how the conditioner would stack up. The thick creamy consistency is exactly what you want out of a conditioner. I worked the thick cream through my tangled mass of curls and then I waited a few minutes before rinsing. Wow! Huge impact! Manageable and easy to untangle, my hair looks and feels so soft and silky and the breakage issue is well on its way to being non-existent. Then theres the gray hair issue, they are now blended into my hair and not sticking up. I actually had to look for graysso much less noticeable! Damaged aging hair is no longer the first thing I see in the mirror. I would highly recommend it to friends and family and I will definitely continue using Pantene Pro-V Age Defy. Very well done Pantene! GotItFree This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Since I've started using them (about 2 months ago), I've noticed the look AND feel of my hair change dramatically. It's softer, easier to manage there's no residue left from the shampoo/conditioner. You can visibly see the differences as well - my hair doesn't have those frizzies it's healthier looking (has a beautiful shine). I'm really impressed! Another huge benefit is that I don't need as much conditioner (you can really tell the quality) as other brands I've tried. If you have hair issues, you MUST give Pantene's Age Defy a try!!

Although the colour of the conditioner is pretty bland and unappealing (reminds me of cement paste), it does the job and leaves my hair smooth and soft and silky! No tangles or knots for me! I'm very happy with how the AgeDefy line is keeping my flyaway grey hairs in check (at least 80 better than before I tried this product). Would definitely buy this in the future.

The day of my lunch plans, that morning, I grabbed my towel, my Pantene Pro-V AgeDefy shampooconditioner. Got water to temp and wet hair. Squeezed nickel size amount of shampoo as I have long hair. Lathered shampoo into hair and the amount was plenty enough for my head. It rinsed out so clean, it actually squeaked! Next I used the conditioner, same amount as I used with the shampoo which was plenty enough to saturate my hair and scalp. After rinsing all the conditioner out, wrapped hair in towel to soak up excess water! After removing towel and towel dried hair I looked at hair it looked so shiny. It felt so clean and light! Most conditioners don't rinse out clean and your hair feels heavy and afterwards my hair looks greasy! Brushing it was so easy, so smooth and silky! No knots to fight with and loosing a handful of hair. I blow dried my hair and OMG, it felt even lighter! Wasn't sure if I had hair on my head! LOL! It was light and fluffy.

Think Look, and 7. Dryness. Once again the company delivers on what they are promoting with the conditioner. It has helped my hair to regain the shine, tame the fly aways, and help with the split ends, breakage, and to make my hair look fuller. Now what I did find with this conditioner is if I didn't use it every day my hair was built up with static. I like to be able to use conditioner every other day or every two days.

It smells crisp and refreshing. The best thing about it is that it lasts for a while too - my husband told me my hair smelled good and I was on day 3 hair!

This conditioner is quite thick in consistency but blends into the hair surprisingly well. It gives just the right amount of slickness to allow me to de-tangle my hair with my fingers only, without feeling like I'm pulling too much or causing any damage.

As I had reported in my review of the matching shampoo (Age Defy), I was a little hesitant at first to use this line as I did not have good experiences with some of Pantene's other shampoos and conditioners. I found some of Pantene's other conditioners to have too strong a scent (and not a pleasant scent in my opinion), as well as weighing my hair down. Just like it's matching shampoo, the Age Defy conditioner had a pleasant smell that was not strong at all. With my fine hair, the conditioner gave my hair some nice volume and bounce.

Wowza. It's thick out of the bottle. I'm talking THICK. But it covers so well, so a little goes a long way. I assume you're all like me.

A lot of other conditioners end up running down my face (yikes) or drips into my eyes (ouch) or completely rinsing out of my hair without me ever touching it (boo). Not this stuff. It smells phenomenal, and is soooooo silky. It makes a big difference in blow drying my hair too. I have fine, dry, broken hair.

For those who don't like strong fragrances, you will love the light, natural, floral vanilla like, warm scent of this conditioner. It is nice and thick, so a little will go a long way. I also love how the container is a tube that stands on its cap so the product is always available to be squeezed out. It rinses out without leaving a heavy residue and in the two months using it, my hair always feels strong and full of volume. After two months, I still have 3/4 of the tube full, so happy it will last a long time! I will definitely buy this conditioner again. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

While i'm not willing to overlook it for the shampoo, the conditioner is fantastic. It's thick (hold upside down in your hand and it doesn't move thick) and you only need a small amount to smooth out your hair. i love it!

After the first application, I realized that I only needed a small amount of conditioner compared to other conditioners.

It has a very pleasant scent and is very thick, so it was easy to work through my long, straggly hair. It was a bit difficult to rinse out because it was so thick, but my hair felt silky soft even while wet. After air-drying, my dry, unruly, coarse hair was soft, manageable and laid down quite nicely. I have severe trouble with frizz and this helped much more than other conditioners. It claims to fight the seven signs of aging hair, but my hair has only 3 of these: frizz, unruly grays and dryness.

When using this product I compared it to a salon product that I had been using. It had a thick feel to it and with fairly short hair I didn't need a huge amount for my hair. After washing it then using the conditioner and drying my hair I had less fly aways and very little frizz in my normal day. I am very pleased with this product and I wouldn't leave it on the shelf at the store.

Before I tried this, I was using Tresemme's Smooth Silky sham/cond plus applying 3x the recommended amount of a leave in salon super skinny serum. It was the best I could find, but on some days it just frizzed and looked bad. Then I tried this product and was immediately impressed with performance. My hair was smooth and soft and very manageable. I finally have the soft, healthy looking straight hair I have always wnted. When I put my hair into a ponytail it looks a lot smoother than before. The odor of this product is difficult to deal with the first few days. It smells like cheap hairspray or cheap cologne trying to cover up an even worse smell..

If you use it everyday or every other day it may make your hair brittle (which will cause breakage). Try to wash and condition your hair no earlier than 6 weeks from initial usages (this goes for any keratin or kertain infused treatment is based off your own hair texture). 2) if you have sensitive scalp consult with a professional, they may recommend a different brand. However, a sensitive scalp may get away with using the conditioner only. Keep in mind that a keratin treatment is for straighten and/or loosening curls excessive usage is the same as over processing hair with dye, relaxers, perms, etc. Keep another shampoo and conditioner handy for your normal routine."

I purchased this conditioner thinking it would be better than just regular conditioner. It's okay but I don't think my hair likes it. It is super thick and I think I need to use the regular Cream of Nature. I need the conditioner to be more creamy and water soluble.

I am an African American female who is relaxer free. My hair is afro textured and it is naturally dry. I usually use Aussie moist as my deep conditioner but I wanted to try something new. I purchased this item in the little packet size first because the bottle is a bit out of my comfort zone far as price and I didn't want to get stuck with a pricey bottle of conditioner that I didn't even like go through the whole process of returning it that's if I could, etc you get the point. I washed my hair as usual with my own shampoo, and then placed the Cream of Nature Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning Treatment on my hair and covered it with a plastic cap for about 30 minutes. When I tell you the results were amazing! Believe me! My hair was so moisturized and it looked as if I had already moisturized my hair with an oil."

It also does not lather very welland so one has to use quite a bit, and then it's still difficult to disperse all over your scalp.

I've used it thrice, in conjunction with the Hairever pre-shampoo scalp treatment.If you've got a super oily SCALP, it also removes scalp odor quite effectively, so you won't have to wash your hair everyday.You might want to do 2 washings if you have product buildup, such as serums, leave-ins, or hair spray, which might explain why one reviewer said the shampoo didn't suds much.It WILL suds on the second wash, once the initial buildup has been washed from your hair.However, I've found that ONE wash will suffice, as I do not care to strip the oils from my hair."

Upon using the hair color and then using this Multiplier, my amount of hair shed was near to nothing...there''s a 1st! My hair is shoulder-length, baby-fine, average density and graying at roots. Texture changed with age (47) from slick-straight to wavy with fly-away ends/outer layer. To curb damage, I only co-wash every other day, and I only shampoo with monthly with Argan Oil Rx7.

As a conditioner it's fairly decent (at fixing/preventing damage, adding shine/volume, detangling), but it does run out fast if you have long hair. The smell is also good and interesting, but a little strange. The unique teatree scent smells... off when mixed with flowery scented soap or shampoo, so be aware of that."

It wakes your senses and leaves your hair feeling flowly and beautiful. I've been using this for 2 months and it works pretty decently. at first, for the first week or so, I acquired dandruff because of this conditioner (and the shampoo), and a lot of my hair would fall out. But I kept using it and eventually learned to use it in a certain way so my hair would be feeling good after the shower. I have naturally straight hair and i have A LOT of hair--its all pretty healthy, but I like to give it that extra moisturizing hydration so my hair isn't so dry at times. my routine for awesome hair: 1. wash/rinse hair with warm water 2. lather shampoo all over hair, scrub and massage hair from roots to ends 3. rinse with warm/lukewarm water 4. apply conditioner to mid-ends of hair and massage it through hair, (it may depend on your hair, but for me, I can not apply conditioner to my roots--it makes my hair fall out) 5. rinse entire head of hair with cold water. the cold water closes the cuticles of your hair strands and keeps the moisture locked in. this product is great for natural hair types and leaves your hair feeling refreshed, light, flowly, soft, silky, and gorgeously beautiful."

Smells great and makes our hair feel soft. However, every few weeks we have had to switch to an alternate shampoo and conditioner for a few days as the Clear would make our scalps itchy. We both were seeing a lot of hair in the drain catcher with every shampooing with the Clear products but just chalked it up to the fact that we both have longer, wavy hair. About a week and a half ago we decided to try something different that a sales clerk suggested. We have been using Paul Mitchell Lavender and Mint shampoo and conditioner and have found we are only losing very few strands of hair with each washing. This leads me to the conclusion that the large amounts of hair in the drain while using the Clear was NOT a normal amount of hair loss! It was caused by the Clear.

I have used it ever since it came out. The original formula smelled so incredible. It made my hair soft, smooth, and shiny. I recommended it to everyone. I also used to get several comments on how nice my hair smelled. Then the formula changed. I was in the shower and opened my new bottle of clear and it was no longer the sweet aroma I had loved. It was new it was different, and I did not like it. As soon as I got out of the shower my husband and I went to several stores and bought all the old formula version of clear we could find. But sadly that quickly ran out. The new formula irritated my scalp and made it very sensitive. I now switch between Pantene and Dove shampoo. I would not recommend the new formula of clear shampoo to my worst enemy with how bad it irritated my scalp. I wish they would switch back to the original formula"

The product is very good but the design of the bottle prevents it from being easily dispensed. One has to get a good grip on it from underneath, somewhat similar to grabbing a big bottle of ketchup, otherwise it will slip out of the hand. This is inconvenient and annoying. A shame really because the product itself is remarkably effective and well-thought out."

Not only has it helped detangle my locks, which have been prone to knots for as long as I can remember, but it smelled incredible. In fact, I had multiple people tell me over the years how amazing my hair smelled, which was always a wonderful confidence boost! I was open-minded about the new formula, wanting to believe that my trusted and favorite brand would not let me down. I know coconut oil has many benefits, but my hair is more tangled and difficult to brush than it's been since I started using Clear. Also, the scent is very disappointing and a huge downgrade. Coconut can smell very good, but not when mixed in with the other ingredients or when it's used in a hot and steamy shower. Clearly, the new formula just isn't working for me and I'm devastated to admit I'm considering switching brands. Coming from someone who was pretty much a brand amabassador for Clear, this is very upsetting. Perhaps some people like this change, but I really wish Clear would bring back the old formula.

I was going through an excessively stressful time, and experiencing hormonal/endocrine/autoimmune issues...a recipe for disaster as far as hair is concerned.

We are both allergic to many dyes, fragrances, and preservatives in personal care items. She is quite sensitive to shampoos and conditioners. She also colors her hair (no allergies to that!) and didn't want to use hair products that wash out her beautiful red hair. This product care line, both shampoo and conditioner are a godsend. Neither of us have had any allergic reaction, and our hair looks great! No more itchies, no more flakes, and her hair color is maintaining just fine. This shampoo has a nice light scent also, and leaves no residue, it washes out completely. I look forward to seeing if more products will follow this.

Had colored it blonde (natural color is brown) since 7th grade. I've decided to let my hair grow out to its natural color. However the old Shampoo of Dove or anything else like Pantene, or Garnier really made my Roots Absolutely the worst grease pit ever! I finally found that the 1.00 bottle of Suave was the only thing that wouldn't make it so greasy. Prob bc its so cheap and had no moisturizers. After about 7 months my scalp would itch like no other! The middle part of the back of my head, the sides and top. All itched so so so bad. I was looking for things like Head and shoulders for dry scalp and nothing other than dandruff was mentioned on the bottles. Came across this, that was FOR scalp. Figured why not. Knew better than Pantene which is terrible now. Not spending LARGE amount of money either for the product to fail once again. This was actually, buy 1 get 1 free, so I was happy :) Tried it, my head felt an EMENSE amount of relief. No more itching. This was AFTER the 1st wash! So happy with this product. Went back and got another set of the buy one get one free! :) I'm more than half way through the bottles. I hope they continue to amaze me. Also the smell is a wonderful, clean smell. My boyfriend commented it smelled good :) And that was after a full day of work :) I wash every other day and the smell stays and the 2nd day is great to. Silky, smooth."

I've had a problem for a long time with severe flakiness on my scalp, even on my face between my eyebrows, on the edge of my nose and on my ears. I have tried every dandruff, psoriasis, and eczema shampoo and conditioner out there. I've even tried prescription shampoos. Absolutely nothing worked. I started using Clear and within a week all of the giant, scab-like flakes were gone and they stay gone as long as I'm using Clear. I also started using it on my face daily (I know, it's not intended to be a facial cleanser) and the dry flakiness that no moisturizer or heaviest cream could fix is gone. I'd love to see them come up with a facial cleanser and body wash with the Clear formulation. Anyway, in conclusion, if you have stubborn scalp issues like me, buy this and use it for a month.

AVpfRE4tilAPnD_xYdo_,Ogx,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Health & Beauty,Hair Care & Styling,Shampoos & Conditioners,Beauty,Hair Treatments,Styling Products,Oils & Serums",Fabulous price + fantastic results 10/10 from me. I've only used it once so far but I can definitely see a huge difference in the shine and smoothness of my hair. So glad it works as well as some of the more expensive keratin conditioners I've been using.
AVpfRE4tilAPnD_xYdo_,Ogx,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Health & Beauty,Hair Care & Styling,Shampoos & Conditioners,Beauty,Hair Treatments,Styling Products,Oils & Serums","This hair treatment is a formula with keratin proteins and argan oil. Unless you've been living in a box for the past couple years you'll know those are sort of the two hot ingredients the hair industry has been touting.I picked it up because the price point was attractive in comparison with similar products. I was unsure if it was going to be very effective because I've had mixed experience with Organix before but I am really happy I picked it up. It is a wonderful formula.You apply it to clean hair in the shower like many of these type of products. You're supposed to leave it three minutes but I just leave it however long it takes me to accomplish everything else I'm doing which is probably 3-5 minutes. Three minutes seems to be totally adequate.It is incredibly satisfying because it is one of those great ones that it feels like your hair is just drinking up and incorporating it in it's structure and there isn't a feeling of any of it is wasted going down the drain even when you rinse.The results are noticeable and make your hair feel amazing for a few days and leave it in better condition even longer. It improves hair's texture, appearance, and strength. It also smells fantastic for the whole next day. My ragged ends are much improved and I also believe it fights frizz although it doesn't make that claim.On days which my hair particularly suffers in the heat, humidity, in the pool, or after a long exercise I actually apply a bit to my tips after I'm out of the shower and get great results from this also. There is no feeling of slick oiliness, it just feels like your hair is bare but much improved.I will absolutely be a repeat customer."

I wear it in its natural state. This product did not make my hair curly, but it did make my hair's pattern stand out more. I have used the product in 2 ways. One times I washed my hair and then added the care free curl when it was damp, doing that made my hair SO easy to comb through. On other days I have braided my hair and then added some of the product to each braid, my hair gets softer and softer with each passing hour. By the next day it is like a fluffy cloud. The downside is that this product leaves your hair feeling waxy and unpleasant until it dries completely and sets in. Once it does that, you can't tell you have anything on your hair, but it's still soft and easier to manage. I would suggest using the product well before you plan to style your hair. It really does need time to set in."

My hair still is not exactly curly, but I think that when I put perm rods or rollers in my hair, this product will help make it that way. For now, I just like the softness it puts in my hair.

I then decided to find products that work well with my low porosity hair and I cam across this one and to be honest my hair feels sooooo much better, it actually feels moisturized.. believe me I have tried everything on my transitioning hair... please give it sometime to dry and let your hair capture the moisture..

I also wanted to note that I have blonde, color treated hair. Please keep in mind that just because a product does/does not work for me, does not mean it will/will not work for you. Different products work very different on different hair/skin types. Inside the VoxBox was a clay pre-shampoo treatment, a shampoo, and a conditioner. It claims that there are three different types of clays in this system, all which work together to keep your ends hydrated and your roots non-greasy for a minimum of 48 hours. I was super excited to try this and have been trying it for a little over a month now. I am sadto say that this treatment did not work for me. With my normal hair care regime, my hair will stay non-greasy for about two days. If I used the clay system in the morning, my hair would be greasy by either that night, or the next morning. So my hair actually got greasy faster than usual. My hair would also be very very flat and lifeless as soon as it dried.

Overall, I liked this cone itinerary but it didnt provideo enough moisture at the ends of my hair. It made my hair feel nice aND light and didn't weigh it down, but i need more moisture in the winter months. I focus conditioner mainly at the lengths and ends of my hair and this had a light and please scent. I will say that for the winter months, the shampoo and conditioner are a little too drying for my already dry hair and scalp.

Would probably even recommend a deep conditioner for the ends of the hair after using the mask and shampoo. Definitely wouldn't say this product is needed.

I felt like the conditioner didn't really untangle my hair at all. I had to use so much to make my hair tangle free and it made my hair more oily! The shampoo was okay.

As I mentioned in my reviews of the shampoo and the clay mask, this product did not help with decreasing the grease that accumulates at the root of the hair, and it does not smell great.

There's really nothing special about it. There is a chemical smell to it that I do not like, but is tolerable.

It was fun using all of them together, but honestly I can't say they work any better at keeping oil away than other shampoos and conditioners. I still got my typical oily hair two days after, and actually I feel like my hair looked oilier than it would if I used other products!! I did like how my hair looked on the day it got washed, so that's why I gave three stars, but otherwise I would not get this again to keep oil away. I do also find that this conditioner is a bit on the heavier side, especially for very fine hair like my own, so I did not have any volume from this product, my hair was rather weighed down.

AVpfW8y_LJeJML437ySW,L'oreal Paris,"Beauty,Hair Care,Shampoo & Conditioner,Holiday Shop,Christmas,Featured Brands,Health & Beauty,L'oreal,Personal Care,Hair Treatments,Conditioner","I wanted to like this line. The smell is really nice (though artificial). I don't really think it rinsed out super well though, especially the longer I used the products. For the first few times of using it, my hair felt cleansed and soft after also using the clay mask and the shampoo. But that faded a bit after a couple weeks. I'm a stickler for leaving out unnecessary chemicals and colorings, and these products are filled with them. I'm sure the blue coloring is to try and emulate the clay they claim to use (wish they would point out the clay(s) in the ingredients), but I would much rather them leave out the blue whatever. And the sulfates. But I know many people don't care about those things, and that's ok. If you don't then I recommend trying this line if you have oily skin. Though be aware I think it's because there's salicylic acid (like what's in many acne treatments to dry out your pimples). I tend to have a reaction to it after some time. I noticed my skin started to itch more the longer I used this line I have sensitive skin which is why I avoid the chemicals.

I put the conditioner on after already using the mask and Shampoo from the Extraordinary Clay line. I only apply conditioner to the ends, but I leave it on for 3-7 minutes each time. It washes out easily and I could feel my ends being more silky. However, once my hair air dried, the ends still look dull and dry, but was soft to touch. I found that it was not nourishing enough. As far as being able to go days without washing, that was true. I will continue to use the conditioner to see if over time the look is as good as the touch. **I received this product free for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.

I love the scent of this conditioner. I think that it goes on smooth and washes well without leaving any residue. I didn't like it as much as I thought I would because I noticed that it had sulfates which is an ingredient I tend to avoid for my hair care. I also noticed that when I rinsed out the conditioner, my hair wasn't as hydrated as I had hoped. Since my ends are so dry, I can immediately tell if a product will help or not.

I have oily roots, and dry ends. I am typically not able to go more than 2 days without washing my hair because my roots just look greasy and oily. Second, you would get the best results from this when you use as an entire system. I used the shampoo and conditioner on it'ts own one day and I didn't notice anything different or I didn't notice any extra longevity to my hair. I also used the mask, shampoo, and conditioner routine several days. The conditioner was pretty much your average conditioner. For me personally, I noticed I would need to wash my hair daily because it would look amazing that day, but after sleeping, I would need to wash it the next day due to how dirty my hair looked. I normally try to go every two days when washing my hair because it is such a pain to wash, brush, and dry. I suppose I could start washing my hair daily, but I don't have the extra time everyday to deal with my hair. My experience is neutral.

While I like that this is a very light weight conditioner making it easy to rinse out with no feeling of residue left behind, this was just overall not an exceptional product for me. Did it make my hair feel softer Mostly, but I have other conditioner which make it feel more so. Did it help with my oily roots I believe it did. Did it help with my dry ends I can't really say for sure. The system overall seemed to dry my hair out overall which I don't mind so much but I did have some trouble with static and fly-aways in my ends. Additionally, my hair seemed a bit coarser than when using my normal hair care routine. This is not a bad conditioner. If you have very coarse or very dry hair though I cannot recommend it. For normal to oily hair, it's ok. Not my favorite, but not the worst either. Complimentary products were sent to me from Influenster and L'Oreal for testing/review purposes.

It has a different consistency in comparison to other conditioners this one is runny whereas conditioners are typically a little thicker. I enjoyed this product because I use the entire system when I wash my hair, but I'm not sure if I see a difference with my oily scalp due to this conditioner. It's great for detangling though! After I wash the clay mask out of my hair and shampoo, I squeeze a dime sized amount of conditioner and apply it to my hair by running my hands from the crown of my scalp down to the ends. Then I kind of use my fingers to comb it through so it mainly detangles rather than touches my roots. I will continue to use it though with this system and test to see if it really makes a difference because my leave in conditioner does the same. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I have oily roots, and dry ends, and I am typically not able to go more than 2 days without washing my hair because my roots just look greasy and oily. Second, you would get the best results from this when you use as an entire system. I used the shampoo and conditioner on it'ts own one day and I didn't notice anything different or I didn't notice any extra longevity to my hair. The conditioner was pretty much your average conditioner. While it did leave my hair soft and hydrated, I could not get over the scent. The scent in the entire line is just way too strong for my liking and I feel like with smells that strong, those can only really be achieved with chemicals and I prefer to avoid extra chemicals in my hair if possible. I feel that I did need a bit more styling product in my hair because the conditioner left my hair so soft, it wouldn't hold much of a style. I would say this line works well when used as a system - but again, the scent on all three products was just too much for me. If they made this line in a fragrance free option, I would most likely purchase and give it another shot. As for recommending this, I would not say this is a bad product, I just don't think it really made a big difference in my personal hair. It may very well work for others. I find that using my normal shampoo and conditioner the days I wash and a little dry shampoo applied before I go to bed that night gives me very similar results, if not, a tiny bit better.

It was fun using all of them together, but honestly I can't say they work any better at keeping oil away than other shampoos and conditioners. I still got my typical oily hair two days after, and actually I feel like my hair looked oilier than it would if I used other products!! I did like how my hair looked on the day it got washed, so that's why I gave three stars, but otherwise I would not get this again to keep oil away. I do also find that this conditioner is a bit on the heavier side, especially for very fine hair like my own, so I did not have any volume from this product, my hair was rather weighed down.

Overall, I liked this cone itinerary but it didnt provideo enough moisture at the ends of my hair. It made my hair feel nice aND light and didn't weigh it down, but i need more moisture in the winter months. I focus conditioner mainly at the lengths and ends of my hair and this had a light and please scent.

It has a different consistency in comparison to other conditioners this one is runny whereas conditioners are typically a little thicker. I enjoyed this product because I use the entire system when I wash my hair, but I'm not sure if I see a difference with my oily scalp due to this conditioner. It's great for detangling though! After I wash the clay mask out of my hair and shampoo, I squeeze a dime sized amount of conditioner and apply it to my hair by running my hands from the crown of my scalp down to the ends. Then I kind of use my fingers to comb it through so it mainly detangles rather than touches my roots.

The smell is really nice (though artificial). I don't really think it rinsed out super well though, especially the longer I used the products. For the first few times of using it, my hair felt cleansed and soft after also using the clay mask and the shampoo. But that faded a bit after a couple weeks. I'm a stickler for leaving out unnecessary chemicals and colorings, and these products are filled with them. I'm sure the blue coloring is to try and emulate the clay they claim to use (wish they would point out the clay(s) in the ingredients), but I would much rather them leave out the blue whatever. And the sulfates. But I know many people don't care about those things, and that's ok. If you don't then I recommend trying this line if you have oily skin. Though be aware I think it's because there's salicylic acid (like what's in many acne treatments to dry out your pimples). I tend to have a reaction to it after some time. I noticed my skin started to itch more the longer I used this line I have sensitive skin which is why I avoid the chemicals.

The claim is *up to* 48 hours of purified roots and hydrated ends. Bottom line: Yes this 3-step system did help control my oily roots better than my normal shampoo and conditioner. No it did not control it for 48 hours. But I did get over 24! Im a person who can never skip a day of washing my hair (not if I want to leave the house). And with this system, I still can't. BUT I found I could get up the next morning and run errands if I need to, without looking like a hobo. This 3-step system definitely pro-longed the need to wash my hair by several hours. For example, after washing my hair around 6:30 on a Friday morning, by Saturday morning my hair still looked clean and presentable enough to be seen in public - up until about 11 am. After that my hair started to feel grimy and weird, and it lost all volume. I ended up having to pull it back up in a pony tail because it was laying so flat to my head. Dont get me wrong though, this is still a major improvement. Usually my hair is a greasy mess by 8 or 9 pm the same day that I wash it. So all in all, if I have something to run out and do early the next day, then yes the time and effort of using this 3 step system would be a worth it and helpful time saver. But I wouldnt bother with it every day. Which is good because there isnt enough product in the hair mask tub for you to do it every day anyway. It is a tad difficult to spread the mask throughout the roots of your hair when your hair is dry. You end up using a lot, no matter how hard you try to use it sparingly. So just a note, you will run out of the mask long before you run out of the shampoo and conditioner, unless you only use it for special occasions Which brings me to results of using the shampoo and conditioner alone, for those who are interested in just trying those two items. Bottom line: Its still great for oily roots! I wash my hair in the morning and its soft and bouncy and full of volume all throughout my work day - and on into the night. My ends felt hydrated and my roots didnt start to get oily until around 2 am. Which makes me very happy! I can have late night plans after work and my hair is one less thing I have to worry about!

The conditioner smelled stronger than the shampoo, which I LOVED! Becaus usually it's the other way around and your hair doesn't usually smell that strongly afterwards. But this conditioner definitely left my hair smelling amazing and soft. The 48hr challenge didn't work for me, my hair still got oily, but I'd still use this conditioner because of the other benefits it offered. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I have searched for a long time for a reasonably priced shampoo and conditioner for my very greasy and dry hair. the clay masque is great I do however hate the packaging as I get alot of wastage from it. the shampoo and masque defiantly go hand and hand I tried just the shampoo and conditioner alone and did not get the same results.

It does not give me good hair for 48hours as it suggests but I will say it tends to keep my oiliness at bay all day. Especially when i use the hair mask a long with it. I would probably repurchase.

This leads to a few more extra minutes in the shower and a hope and a prayer when I get out that it's all out.

In fact, I didn't see much of a difference at all between the system and my normal routine. While I was left a bit disappointed with the system as a whole, this conditioner was the one bright spot in the bunch. The scent is great and the texture is a perfect balance of rich and light.

The Clay conditioner works great in combination with the Clay Shampoo and Clay mask to truly balance and reset your oily hair. Like I said in my other reviews, just remember that less is more. Be mindful of your own hair and don't use this every day. This combination set is meant to cleanse your hair of excess oils so that you do not need to wash your hair every day. If you DO try to use this every day, then it might strip your hair TOO much and make it dry. But if you follow the instructed use, this works great on non-color treated hair.

I have fine hair that gets oily fast. I usually have to wash my hair every day. This product helped me extend my wash an extra day - with the aid of a dry shampoo. I did not receive the coordinating dry shampoo, so I used one I had at home. I don't think this is the product's fault - I think my hair is too oily. However, I did feel like my roots were not as oily once it was styled in comparison to how they did before. I plan to continue to use this product and its counterparts because I love that I can extend the amount of time I can go without washing my hair. Thanks L'Oreal and Influenster!

Overall, I like the condtitioner a lot. Mixed with the shampoo and mask, this product does the job. I did notice my hair seemed soft after drying. The oily roots were gone and the ends seemed to have a little more life to them. I think this product line could be great if a few things are changed. Most importantly, the clay smell was not my favorite. It was too strong and I smelled it all day on my hair after. The conditioner does smell nice, but does not cover the clay smell.

I've only ever tried one other clay-based shampoo/conditioner combo before, so I was eager to see how this stacked up. Overall, I was very pleased with the series (mask, shampoo, conditioner). Admittedly, after rinsing out the shampoo, my hair didn't feel AMAZING but the conditioner definitely did the trick with smoothing it out. The conditioner went on easy, smelled great, and I swear my knot-ridden, tangly hair felt like new! My hair looks amazing, feels rid of build up, and smells fantastic. It won't make sense for me to use this shampoo each time I shower, but definitely on a bi-weekly basis. Of course, I'd like to note that I was sent the L'Oreal Hair Expertise Extraordinary Clay Rebalancing Shampoo from Influenster free for review. Of course, all opinions are my own!

It has a pleasant smell and goes on nicely. I usually prefer showering everyday because I really just can't take the oiliness of my hair if I don't so I was depending on this to maybe change my ways. I have used it every time I shower but even though I go a day without cleaning my hair, my hair continues to be oily and my ends are still dry. It does condition my hair but does not exactly do as it claims. I am hoping to still give it a chance by continuing to use it so we will see.

I've moved to using this in between a moisturizing conditioner because my hair seemed to be getting two dry combining the two too often. On the other hand, the conditioner and shampoo has really helped my boyfriend! While I consider my hair oily, his scalp produces oil more productively than anyone I know. This has really helped him out. If you have moderately oily hair, I would advise using this once a week especially for nights when you want a lot of body and fullness because this conditioner really helps with that compared to others. If you have extremely oily hair, use this all the time. I received this item free via an Influenster Voxbox. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I received this conditioner along with the Extraordinary Clay Shampoo Hair Mask free for testing purposes. I started by messaging the clay mask, first, into the roots all over my scalp. I let it work it's magic for about 10 minutes. The mask was hard like a clay face mask would get on your face. I proceeded by rinsing my hair out and followed it by using the Shampoo and Conditioner. As soon as the conditioner was rinsing out of my hair I could just feel the difference in my hair texture! I would recommend this line to anyone!!

I tried it as part of a 3-step system that includes the shampoo and conditioner and I have to say that it seemed to work for my hair. I went from shampooing my hair every other day, to doing it only twice a week. The first time I used the system my hair did not get oily until the end of the 3rd day, which was AMAZING, but as I used it, I saw that my hair got used to it and my hair started getting oily by the 2nd day. This conditioner was INCREDIBLY MOISTURIZING to the point that I thought I was putting a mask on my hair (and not to mention how great it smells!) Overall, I do recommend you try it if you have dry ends and very oily roots. I know how frustrating it is (and not to mention damaging!) to have to wash you hair every day or every other day.

It smells great and is a good complement to the mask and shampoo but I would not say that it made an impactful difference in my hair oil control. Perhaps it's too soon to tell. I am hopeful. Great price! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I love using clay products and I was very excited to try this! The conditioner smells good very fresh and minty. After using this, I did notice that my hair was very clean and did not get oily until the 3rd day. I was my hair twice a week, so this product helps me keep my hair feeling clean longer.

It is thick which is nice because I do not have to use much for my long hair. I use the conditioner after using the mask and shampoo in order to get the full effect of the products. I did notice my hair was less greasy than usual but it didn't make a great impact on how many days I could go without showering my hair. I only apply the conditioner to the end of my hair and not to the crown. I could always try that and see if it makes a difference then. Overall for the price, it would be a good buy.

The Conditioner is the icing on the cake for the 3 step system. The mud removes impurities, the Shampoo sets the stage, primes your hair and this Conditioner, like I said, is definitely the icing on the cake in this trifecta. It softens the hair and seals it. As a whole, I was initially very satisfied but feel this conditioner, as a part of the 3 step system, is best used once a week or once every two weeks. I gave it a 4 star rating because I am not sure that the Shampoo and Conditioner combo is recommended for use without the mud pre-mask. Other than that as far as conditioners go, it does the job, has a great consistency and is fragrant, not overbearing. Leave hair looking good and feeling great. On the initial use, I did a 48 hour challenge and it stood the test. My hair still looked great and wasn't nearly as greasy and oily as it was before I tried the trifecta. I would recommend this product to a friend. I received this product complimentary for review and testing purposes. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

It has a pleasant smell and goes on nicely. I usually prefer showering everyday because I really just can't take the oiliness of my hair if I don't so I was depending on this to maybe change my ways. I have used it every time I shower but even though I go a day without cleaning my hair, my hair continues to be oily and my ends are still dry.

Pretty simple. It does an ok job at conditioning hair but it definitely isn't a miracle worker. It smells ok and the consistency is fairly thick so it coats the hair nicely. My roots and ends stayed in the same condition before trying this system. I believe that these products are more beneficial to those with thin hair.

In fact, I didn't see much of a difference at all between the system and my normal routine. While I was left a bit disappointed with the system as a whole, this conditioner was the one bright spot in the bunch. The scent is great and the texture is a perfect balance of rich and light.

The scent actually stuck with my hair 2-3 days after I washed, which I love! Didn't weigh my hair down at all, but didn't leave it super soft either. I would consider this more of a volumizing conditioner. I applied only to me ends and let sit for a couple of minutes. Next time, I will apply it to my entire head (sparingly) to see if it leaves hair softer and more conditioned.

This conditioner smells great and conditions well and has a good consistency. I do not use this conditioner near my roots so I'm not sure if it's supposed to condition the roots without making them greasy. I have very fine hair that's prone to oiliness and limpness but this product does a good job on my ends. I'm not stench if the clay formula has any special effect in this conditioner or if any other conditioner would yield similar results. My hair feel a soft after use.

I tried it as part of a 3-step system that includes the shampoo and conditioner and I have to say that it seemed to work for my hair. I went from shampooing my hair every other day, to doing it only twice a week. The first time I used the system my hair did not get oily until the end of the 3rd day, which was AMAZING, but as I used it, I saw that my hair got used to it and my hair started getting oily by the 2nd day. This conditioner was INCREDIBLY MOISTURIZING to the point that I thought I was putting a mask on my hair (and not to mention how great it smells!) Overall, I do recommend you try it if you have dry ends and very oily roots. I know how frustrating it is (and not to mention damaging!) to have to wash you hair every day or every other day.

I always make sure to use a conditioner with my shampoos this way my hair stays soft otherwise shampoo alone can make my hair dry. I like how this made my hair more managable i noticed my hair was soft feeling and had a nice shine to it after. I think this is a nice affordable conditiner that works well.

It helps a lot with my dry ends and smooths and shines my hair but as for controlling the oil it doesn't help. This review was collected as part of a promotion.
AVpfW8y_LJeJML437ySW,L'oreal Paris,"Beauty,Hair Care,Shampoo & Conditioner,Holiday Shop,Christmas,Featured Brands,Health & Beauty,L'oreal,Personal Care,Hair Treatments,Conditioner","Loreal Extraordinary Clay Pre-Shampoo Mask (spread throughout dry roots and rinse out after 5 minutes), Shampoo Conditioner for oily roots and dry ends. The claim is *up to* 48 hours of purified roots and hydrated ends. Bottom line: Yes this 3-step system did help control my oily roots better than my normal shampoo and conditioner. No it did not control it for 48 hours. But I did get over 24! Im a person who can never skip a day of washing my hair (not if I want to leave the house). And with this system, I still can't. BUT I found I could get up the next morning and run errands if I need to, without looking like a hobo. This 3-step system definitely pro-longed the need to wash my hair by several hours. For example, after washing my hair around 6:30 on a Friday morning, by Saturday morning my hair still looked clean and presentable enough to be seen in public - up until about 11 am. After that my hair started to feel grimy and weird, and it lost all volume. I ended up having to pull it back up in a pony tail because it was laying so flat to my head. Dont get me wrong though, this is still a major improvement. Usually my hair is a greasy mess by 8 or 9 pm the same day that I wash it. So all in all, if I have something to run out and do early the next day, then yes the time and effort of using this 3 step system would be a worth it and helpful time saver. But I wouldnt bother with it every day. Which is good because there isnt enough product in the hair mask tub for you to do it every day anyway. It is a tad difficult to spread the mask throughout the roots of your hair when your hair is dry. You end up using a lot, no matter how hard you try to use it sparingly. So just a note, you will run out of the mask long before you run out of the shampoo and conditioner, unless you only use it for special occasions Which brings me to results of using the shampoo and conditioner alone, for those who are interested in just trying those two items. Bottom line: Its still great for oily roots! I wash my hair in the morning and its soft and bouncy and full of volume all throughout my work day - and on into the night. My ends felt hydrated and my roots didnt start to get oily until around 2 am. Which makes me very happy! I can have late night plans after work and my hair is one less thing I have to worry about! This line gets a thumbs up from me for every day wear, even without the mask. Received free from Influenster for testing and review purposes. All opinions are my own.

It is so perfect for my hair. This conditioner leaves my hair so soft, shiny, and feeling healthy without weighing it down or making roots oily as so many other products do. It is a thinner consistency compared to many conditioners but does an amazing job hydrating my hair! The only downside to this product is it makes my shower floor extremely slippery and I have to wipe out the shower floor after I use it, but that isn't enough of an inconvenience to stop me from using it.

The Clay conditioner works great in combination with the Clay Shampoo and Clay mask to truly balance and reset your oily hair. Like I said in my other reviews, just remember that less is more. Be mindful of your own hair and don't use this every day. This combination set is meant to cleanse your hair of excess oils so that you do not need to wash your hair every day. If you DO try to use this every day, then it might strip your hair TOO much and make it dry. But if you follow the instructed use, this works great on non-color treated hair.

The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was because I would like for it to be able to be used as a deep conditioning mask as well.

The Conditioner is the icing on the cake for the 3 step system. The mud removes impurities, the Shampoo sets the stage, primes your hair and this Conditioner, like I said, is definitely the icing on the cake in this trifecta. It softens the hair and seals it. As a whole, I was initially very satisfied but feel this conditioner, as a part of the 3 step system, is best used once a week or once every two weeks. I gave it a 4 star rating because I am not sure that the Shampoo and Conditioner combo is recommended for use without the mud pre-mask. Other than that as far as conditioners go, it does the job, has a great consistency and is fragrant, not overbearing. Leave hair looking good and feeling great. On the initial use, I did a 48 hour challenge and it stood the test. My hair still looked great and wasn't nearly as greasy and oily as it was before I tried the trifecta.

I've moved to using this in between a moisturizing conditioner because my hair seemed to be getting two dry combining the two too often. On the other hand, the conditioner and shampoo has really helped my boyfriend! While I consider my hair oily, his scalp produces oil more productively than anyone I know. This has really helped him out. If you have moderately oily hair, I would advise using this once a week especially for nights when you want a lot of body and fullness because this conditioner really helps with that compared to others.

Out of all 3 products, this is the only one I would use by itself. The others by themselves left my hair a bit stiff but this with a different shampoo still left may hair feeling soft.

My hair is oily at the roots and dry at the ends and this has solved both problems. The mask is a great addition to the shampoo and conditioner, even if you don't want to use it every day. You put the mask on when your hair is dry, then get in the shower/tub to rinse it out and shampoo/condition as usual. I'm not sure if it was the combination of the three (mask, shampoo and conditioner) or if one of them is the miracle worker... but I also am super thrilled that I haven't had to use dandruff shampoo since starting to use these products. I don't have super bad dandruff... but if I don't use dandruff shampoo/conditioner once a week I get a really dry, itchy scalp. Since using this combination of products, I haven't had to use it once... and my scalp feels amazing.

I loved this L'Oreal Paris line for hitting the spot on what my hair type was about! i have oily roots, and dried out ends. I was so excited to try this i used it immediately! What i can say about this is that it worked very nice- but for the wrong reason. When i used the clay for the roots, i truly didn't feel it helped with my oily roots at all. After, using this shampoo- i did feel a luscious rinse where the shampoo was soothing and nourishing to my hair. It really felt like it washed away any impurities and left my hair feeling absolutely amazing! it was shiny, and light, even looked longer! With the final use of the conditioner I really felt I was in a spa! It made my hair and scalp so smooth while rinsing I didnt want to stop! i would try again, and it's a great trusted brand and wonderful quality for hair care.

AVpfW8y_LJeJML437ySW,L'oreal Paris,"Beauty,Hair Care,Shampoo & Conditioner,Holiday Shop,Christmas,Featured Brands,Health & Beauty,L'oreal,Personal Care,Hair Treatments,Conditioner","This conditioner is part of the L'Oreal Extraordinary Clay hair care system (Mask, Shampoo, Conditioner) which is designed to treat the different requirements of an oily scalp and roots and dry ends. This balancing system of hair care is designed to break the cycle of combination hair. After shampoo, apply the conditioner to wet hair and massage it into hair from mid-length to ends. I let the conditioner sit on my hair for a couple of minutes, comb through and rinse as usual. This conditioner is light-weight and moisturizing allowing daily use, however using it with the other products in the Extraordinary Clay system will allow combination hair to stay fresh, soft and hydrated for up to 3 days. The packaging is an attractive green bottle which matches the colour design of the mask and shampoo in the system. I really like that L'Oreal designs the conditioner bottle to dispense the product from the opposite end. This helps to distinguish the shampoo and the conditioner bottles while I am in the shower. The product is white and creamy with a pleasant herbal scent. I have used this conditioner multiple times and have found that it coats the hair well, is easy to comb through the hair and rinses cleanly. My hair feels immediately moisturized without being greasy or oily. As a bonus, this conditioner is silicone-free. This product is effective to use on its own or as part of the Extraordinary Clay system and I feel that the conditioner, and the entire system, is a great value for the money.

First, I applied the clay mask to my roots. I let this sit for about 5-10 minutes pre-shower. Once in the shower, I then rinsed it off. I continued with the shampoo, making sure to really scrub my roots. After, I applied the conditioner and let this sit for about 5 minutes in the shower. Once out, I towel dried my hair and let air dry. I'm not sure what effect blow drying or using heat tools would have after using this product. But, having let air dry, my hair was less wavy and tangled than normal. Not did my hair feel more silky, but it also looked more silky and healthy. Usually, I can only go one day without washing my hair however, after using this product/line together I was able to go two days. My roots were very voluminous after washing with these products and my scalp felt genuinely clean. It is definitely unlike any other shower hair products I have used. Aside from the clean feeling and volume, I also felt like my hair texture was silkier and would get tangled less frequently. My one con would be the smell during the shower, although I didn't notice it afterwards. However, my boyfriend commented that my hair smelled good after so this could just be my personal preferences.

Same as the shampoo it comes in the pretty mint green, very pretty packaging I do love that in products. Plus for me. Ok so after the rich lather and rinse of the shampoo my scalp is feeling refreshed, clean, and I reach for the conditioner. I dispense, and smell, same clean fragrance I know and love at this point. Apply to my ends it feels so silky and soft. I always leave my conditioner on for at least a minute to sit, so rinsing was so nice I could already feel the softness of my hair, I couldn't wait to see how this all turned out. After drying I'm mind blown. My scalp is rejuvenated while my hair is so clean, fresh, and smells amazing. My ends are pure silk, and I'm highly impressed! Everyone's hair is different, but this just works! I've tried and spent so much money on hair care, I've finally found my routine. Mask, shampoo/conditioner. I have to say this was a great experience, the clay is all so new to me but it works! I've never been able to skip a hair wash but now I can take better care of my hair with this line of extraordinary clay. My oily roots are non existent while my hair is fresh, lightweight, and hydrated. It's everything we've been looking for.

Now I can go up to 3-4 days without having to wash my hair, it feels fresh and clean, even more if you apply a little dry shampoo after the second day!

It really helps to combat the drying effects of the shampoo, while giving extra love to ends that were already super dry to begin with. Each drop helps my hair to feel silkier and softer. I also really enjoy the way it smells Using this with the shampoo is a must but sometimes I forgo the mask. Still, my ends look and feel radiant because of this, and it's even easier to comb my fingers through. If you want to go from being Severus Snape to Sirius Black, this is for you.

I used to bleach my hair a bit, but am letting it grow out now so my natural roots are oily but my bleached ends are dry. I have been using the three step system (pre-shampoo, shampoo and conditioner) for a while now and have seen an immense difference. My roots no longer look oily and it has become a lot easier to style my hair. I only use the product on my scalp, not my ends.

I was hesitant at first because I have really long hair and a lot of it. I go through conditioner regularly. I condition my hair A LOT!! I used the Extraordinary Clay Mask first - and then the Extraordinary Clay Shampoo to rinse out the mask and then applied the conditioner. I put my normal amount of conditioner in my hand and immediately found out I did not need as much of this conditioner. It worked well and needed less product. I use the mask once a week. In between I use just the shampoo and conditioner. Still I didn't need as much of this conditioner! I love it!! The scent is nice and fresh as well. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

Next you just rinse it off in the showe and then proceed to shampoo. Lastly you use the conditioner.

It was also very easy to manage, which is awesome because my hair usually becomes tangled fairly easily even though I have fine, straight hair.

AVpfW8y_LJeJML437ySW,L'oreal Paris,"Beauty,Hair Care,Shampoo & Conditioner,Holiday Shop,Christmas,Featured Brands,Health & Beauty,L'oreal,Personal Care,Hair Treatments,Conditioner","This is a nice conditioner that leaves my hair feeling silky smooth and nice. I have normal hair type, which is highlighted. I was skeptical about the claim regarding the clay -- Clay is usually used on the skin such as in a facial mask it absorbs a lot of oil and in this use the label states it is supposed to ansorb the excess oil on your scalp in order to help an oily scalp. I was concerned if this would dry out the skin on my scalp and therefore lead to flaking dandruff but this has not happened. This product is advertised to have no silicone, for people who are trying to avoid silicone products due to health threats. My regular conditioning product is by Sukin in which is all natural and uses essential oils for scent (which is lightly scented). In comparison this L'Oreal product is very highly scented to a point where once I use it my whole shower smells of it, it masks over the scent of my fragranced soap, it seems to emit while I'm blow-drying my hair and I can smell the scent in my hair all day i received these products free/complimentary for testing purposes, but all opinions are your own.

AVpfW8y_LJeJML437ySW,L'oreal Paris,"Beauty,Hair Care,Shampoo & Conditioner,Holiday Shop,Christmas,Featured Brands,Health & Beauty,L'oreal,Personal Care,Hair Treatments,Conditioner","I have only used this conditioner (and shampoo) once but I am ready to do this review, because I felt the difference after just ONE use!! My hair is dry and damaged from too much cleansing, cheap products, home and salon color, blow-drying, and general mistreatment. I picked up this clay line without expecting much, but wow, I am sooo impressed! I literally felt my hair become moisturized in the shower, and afterward it was so much easier to comb. I have coarse hair that used to be straight but my waves have really come out over the years. I get knots underneath by my neck often. After I blow-dried my hair for a few minutes, I felt how much softer it felt. I am using both the shampoo and conditioner, and cannot wait to see what continued use will do. And, it smells awesome!!"
AVpfW8y_LJeJML437ySW,L'oreal Paris,"Beauty,Hair Care,Shampoo & Conditioner,Holiday Shop,Christmas,Featured Brands,Health & Beauty,L'oreal,Personal Care,Hair Treatments,Conditioner","I've never been super into L'Oral hair care so I had no idea what to expect when this line came out. I gave this and the shampoo a fair shot, and they did a very good job and cleaning my oily scalp. I have color treated ends that always look dry the conditioner helped with the texture and appearance. The shampoo is what I feel does all the cleaning. I do think I'll repurchase once I run out, so far I'm liking my results! I have the hair mask in this line 3 stars bc it only helped with the oily roots aspect of the line and also I'm not much of a mask person. So if you have oily roots and dry ends, I'd recommend checking out the shampoo and conditioner from this line. Yes I did receive the products mentioned for testing purposes but that did not hinder my review of the products, I don't care if a company wants to get upset over a bad review.

After washing off the clay mask(step1) with the shampoo (step2) I went ahead and applied the conditioner and left it in my hair for about 5 minutes before removing it. After the 5 minutes I used the comb to clear my hair of any knots which by the way was very easy to remove thanks to this conditioner being so rich in texture. My hair was soo smooth and smelled amazinggg. When done removing knots i applied a small amount into my hair againg (something I just do with any conditioner) and then jut left it to air dry. My hair looked amaziinng!!! Nice volume non oily yet had this natural shine that looked insanely beautiful. I had the opportunity to try this totally FREE thanks to influenster but I will definitely go and buy another bottle as soon as I finish this one. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

Not only are they a great value price wise but it's been a total game changer in my morning routine. The product line definitely delivers on its promise of keeping your roots from getting greasy and your ends from being dry for 48 hours and I've found it to go above and beyond that! I never washed my hair daily but usually every other day and sometimes every 3 days depending on what I was doing and how I wore my hair but with this line from L'Oral I can now easily go 3 days between washs with no need for dry shampoo and sometimes even 4 days! Think about that for a minute... 4 days between having to wash your hair! It's a huge time saver and has made my morning routine so much less rushed by making it so I'm only washing my hair 1-2 times per week! Plus you can't beat the price! An all around great product line that I would highly recommend, I even let my Mom test it out and she's hooked now too.

I've used it a couple of times and so far the only con to the product is that you can tell you've had something in your hair even after washing, drying and styling. I would definitely use this product in the future along with the shampoo and mask and would recommend it to a friend. When I use it, I place the clay mask as directed, use the shampoo and conditioner as directed. I style my hair like I normally would (but for testing purposes I didn't use hair spray or any other styling product). The next day my hair wasn't greasy, as it usually is!

But, I am an influenster and willing to try new things. I have to say I was skeptical. I was afraid my hair would turn out greasier than normal. After the first use I was a little more greasier. BUT, the second time I was so amazed. My hair was soft, very smooth, shiny, smelled wonderful, and my hair wasn't as greasy the next morning!! I'm obsessed with using conditioner, and this is by far my favorite. I tend to mix shampoo and conditioner brands. This one is best to use with the Extraordinary Clay shampoo, as any brand would recommend, but this leaves my hair so easy to rinse and clean. I usually use some sort of detangler after I shower to help me brush out my hair and I don't have to after using this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I am particularly dependent upon conditioners as I am in the process of maintaining and continuing to grow my long hair, which is prone to dry, brittle ends with splitting issues. I have tried a few other products from L'Oreal that have helped combat my dry ends and this Clay conditioner is another stellar find. I really enjoy using the whole Clay system and find that my hair is noticeably softer and shinier after washing with this product.

I use the conditioner everydayy in my routine it keeps my roots hydrated while not making my roots too oily.

After balayaging my hair and having to wash my hair every day due to working out and because I work in a hospital, my hair has been so dry, thin, and damaged on the ends but oily at the roots, that it seldom looked good. I had tried countless products, home remedies, and tried not washing it for a few days at a time (I know that most people do this, but I really can't because of my work or could potentially pass infection along to my patients). I received the clay mask, shampoo, and conditioner, and instantly became obsessed. My hair felt nourished, smooth, and clean from root to end. The amazing and subtle smell lasted 48 hours in my hair. I've mentioned this product to so many people, including my coworkers, and have made my friends try it. I love this product and highly encourage other people to use it.

I loved this L'Oreal Paris line for hitting the spot on what my hair type was about! i have oily roots, and dried out ends. I was so excited to try this i used it immediately! What i can say about this is that it worked very nice- but for the wrong reason. When i used the clay for the roots, i truly didn't feel it helped with my oily roots at all. After, using this shampoo- i did feel a luscious rinse where the shampoo was soothing and nourishing to my hair. It really felt like it washed away any impurities and left my hair feeling absolutely amazing! it was shiny, and light, even looked longer! With the final use of the conditioner I really felt I was in a spa! It made my hair and scalp so smooth while rinsing I didnt want to stop! i would try again, and it's a great trusted brand and wonderful quality for hair care.

The formula is perfection with this conditioner! It's light weight and not super thick so it does not weigh my hair or my natural curls down but it's so hydrating! I have never - stress the never- been able to run my fingers through my hair straight out of the shower before I tried this conditioner! It's that awesome! Normally my hair becomes some matted nightmare during my shower my curls go nuts and brushing usually is a 45 minute ordeal the likes of which nightmares are made of (very long, and curly nightmare). Using this conditioner it's like having an army of tangle fighting minions in my corner. As a result my hair is curly as can be too instead of that crazy frizz puff hippie hair I normally get after the brush out. The fragrance is light and pleasing too.

The best feature to me about this product is it's refreshing smell! Not sure what the aroma is but it's the greatest smelling hair profuct I've ever used. I used the this conditioner in combination with the same shampoo on average 3x a week. A little went a long way! It's probably one of the best conditioners I've used in a long time. It doesn't leave a greasy film like other products I've used. Washes out very easily and leaves hair so incredibly soft . I have color treated hair(don't tell) . This product did not fade or cause brassiness to my blonde. I don't generally have oily roots but I still felt like this product was good for my normal type hair and It felt healthy long after a wash.

My hair is oily at the roots and dry at the ends and this has solved both problems. The mask is a great addition to the shampoo and conditioner, even if you don't want to use it every day. You put the mask on when your hair is dry, then get in the shower/tub to rinse it out and shampoo/condition as usual. I'm not sure if it was the combination of the three (mask, shampoo and conditioner) or if one of them is the miracle worker... but I also am super thrilled that I haven't had to use dandruff shampoo since starting to use these products. I don't have super bad dandruff... but if I don't use dandruff shampoo/conditioner once a week I get a really dry, itchy scalp. Since using this combination of products, I haven't had to use it once... and my scalp feels amazing.

My ends are free flowing and shiny and look very healthy. I have only used the conditioner so far, so I can't wait to try using both the shampoo and conditioner together.

I received the clay hair mask, the shampoo and the conditioner. I was very skeptical about this since I am picky of what I put in my hair. I used the mask first it didn't smell the best but thats not the purpose of the product. My hair gets very oily and this product was going to help take the some of the excess oil out. I left the clay mask on for 5 min then jumped in the shower to wash out like it said in the directing. So far I didnt feel much of a difference so I added the shampoo to my wet hair after all the mask was out. I noticed my hair felt lighter. I shampoo smelled a lot better than the mask and made my hair feel a bit softer too. Lastly i applied the conditioner and it definitely changed my mind on using these products.

AVpfW8y_LJeJML437ySW,L'oreal Paris,"Beauty,Hair Care,Shampoo & Conditioner,Holiday Shop,Christmas,Featured Brands,Health & Beauty,L'oreal,Personal Care,Hair Treatments,Conditioner",I started using Loreal's EverPure Sulfate Free Color Care System when I started coloring my hair pink a few months back. Since then my color has faded but I did receive this to try and decided to give it a go. I can't comment on how it would work on color treated hair (whether it would fade or not) but I was very impressed with how it works on oily hair! I have the clay mask and the shampoo as well. Using them together my hair lasted 3 full days without being greasy. Personally my hair gets pretty oily and after a day and a half I usually need to wash it so this was really impressive to me. It didn't give my hair that frizzy dry feeling either which was surprising. Overall I would say if you have oily hair this is worth a try! I received this product free for testing purposes. All opinions are my own. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

Conditioner: I really liked this product. I usually have to use a huge amount of conditioner and I typically use a really thick one as well because my hair loves to tangle. This conditioner isn't super thick but it's a good consistency. I was surprised at how well it actually did de-tangle my hair without having to use half the bottle! Again, this just has a light clean smell, nothing too strong. After wash and drying I felt like my hair didn't have any product build up. It helped me with my typical oily roots and left my hair feeling soft and refreshed. I was able to go a longer stretch of time without washing my hair which is always a plus! Overall I would definitely recommend this product to other people. Especially people who feel like they have oily hair or a lot of product build up. All these items were given to me for free from influenster and l'Oreal to test out and review.

AVpfW8y_LJeJML437ySW,L'oreal Paris,"Beauty,Hair Care,Shampoo & Conditioner,Holiday Shop,Christmas,Featured Brands,Health & Beauty,L'oreal,Personal Care,Hair Treatments,Conditioner","I have decently oily roots, and since my hair is color treated, I have super dry ends. However, I typically wash my hair every other day to every 2 days, depending on the season. I also typically only apply conditioner to the ends of my hair. I've used the conditioner with the matching shampoo. I'm not the hugest fan of the scent of this product, but it's not super overpowering and doesn't linger for very long, so it's definitely tolerable. The conditioner is very lightweight and I don't feel like it adds additional weight/oil to my hair, but I still feel like it hydrates my ends very well. I definitely noticed the ends of my hair feel much softer and less dry than before using this product. Overall I think it's a great product and also a great value, would highly recommend.

I often have problems with my hair getting oily very soon after I wash it, this is a big problem for me especially in the winter when I don't want to wash it as often since it gets more dry/brittle in the cold weather. I used this conditioner along with the shampoo and pre-shampoo mask as directed on the packaging. By the end of the first day my hair was still oil free. By the end of day two I was convinced. My hair had started to get oily again but not anywhere near what it would have been using my normal shampoo/conditioner routine. This coupled with the fact that it is really affordable has pretty much cemented its inclusion in my future beauty routine.

This Voxbox was perfect for me since I have combination hair, oily roots and dry ends. Dry shampoo is my holy grail product, but I do like changing up my hair routine. This unique system by LOreal has three refined clays to purify and remove oil from your scalp and hair. Lately, clay masks for the face have been one of the biggest beauty trends, but what happens when we apply it to our scalp to get rid of oil. Treat yourself to a mini spa session and give your hair some TLC. Give yourself a head massage while applying the mask and then wash it all away with warm water. The conditioner smells very similar, and it has a creamy consistency. It applies very smoothly, I let it soak in for about 5 minutes. After drying my hair, and using only heat protectant spray, my hair felt so soft and moisturized, it had a natural shine and my tips did not feel brittle. Im so happy I got to try this set out! i received this product free in exchange for an honest review This review was collected as part of a promotion."
AVpfW8y_LJeJML437ySW,L'oreal Paris,"Beauty,Hair Care,Shampoo & Conditioner,Holiday Shop,Christmas,Featured Brands,Health & Beauty,L'oreal,Personal Care,Hair Treatments,Conditioner","I did not cleanse my hair for 48 hours before trying this product. I started with the Clay Pre-Shampoo Mask I have very fine hair, so not washing my hair for 48 hours, it becomes very oily. I could feel the mask working when I rubbed it into my hair roots. I waited 10 minutes and rinsed out the mask then washed with the shampoo and followed with this conditioner. Once dry, it was amazing how feathery, fresh and fantastic my hair was. I scarcely had to style it at all. I attended a Holiday party that night. The following day I did not wash it and went to another Holiday party. After 48 hours and 2 Holiday parties my hair remained pure and perfect as if I had just showered and styled it. I will purchase this product as well as recommend it especially if you are a person who suffers, like I do, with fine hair that becomes oily on top and dry on the ends.

I liked the way it felt, I didn't leave the product on my roots for a long period of time, but I did leave it for a little longer on my ends. I liked the way the product smelled and I felt like it was a premier product, luxurious and not weighted down. I used the whole system of pre-shampoo clay, the clay shampoo, and the clay conditioner. Although I did not notice much of a difference in oil control over the next 48 hours, my hair did definitely feel re-balanced, soft, and purified. I do not color my hair with dye, but I do get bleach foils and i did not experience any damage with this product. I received these products for free for testing purposes, but my opinions are my own and not paid. I would buy this product again, and maybe use 1-2 times a year in between hair appointments to remove impurities and buildup. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

In no way shape or form does this influence my opinion of these products. Opinions are solely my own.I followed instructions from the clay mask to the conditioner. I don't believe in washing your hair everyday but I hate that sometimes your hair looks oily and frizzy. L'Oreal couldn't have created a more perfect product. The clay mask cleanses away the impurities on on your scalp while the shampoo and conditioner was away the treatment leaving your hair soft and supple for 48 hours. I didn't even have to use a straightener for my hair and I have wavy hair. My hair looked clean and shiny. BONUS: it's works great for color treated hair. It won't strip the color. I highly recommend these products to anyone who doesn't wash their hair every day. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

I usually apply it after the shampoo and only from the middle of the hair to the tips, and it is impressive that after only one applied, my hair felt much more hydrated, the tips were not so dry and the hair in general was much softer and manageable. This conditioner completely amazed me and has become must have in my hair care. What I should mention is that the smell is a bit strong and lasts a long time in the hair after washing it, so if you are not very fond of menthol or herbal scents, it may be a little annoying for you, The particular does not bother me much. 5 stars for this conditioner because it deserves it, and 100 recommended.

Then after the first time I tried it, I was seriously in shock! Again I thought well it's just bc I changed shampoo conditioner, because that always makes my hair feel great! But here I am almost a month into using this conditioner my hair still feels amazing! I'm so glad Influenster sent me this to try because I never would've bought it on my own!

The conditioner wasn't as thick as I was expecting, but it was still easy to spread throughout my hair and seemed to do a decent job of moisturizing and managing tangles without weighing everything down. I only condition from the middle of my hair down to avoid weighing my hair down at the roots. After rinsing it away, my hair was tangle-free and easy to brush through, and felt bouncy and hydrated. It styled easily and while my hair did seem a bit drier near the roots, it didn't get frizzy or unmanageable throughout the day. I consider that to be a win!

After using the clay mask and rinsing it out and shampooing my hair, I applied a small handful of conditioner on my hair focusing on the ends. It also had a great scent, I notice it stills has a light floral scent days after washing my hair. I recommend using the combination of the clay mask, shampoo and conditioner. However, I would not recommend using the clay mask every time you wash your hair but rather 1-2 times a month to remove oils.

When I have gotten the packeage my hair was already 2 days into a blow-dry so it was super oily and due for a wash. I appied the clay first to my roots and worked my way through. I left it in for 5 minutes and then hopped into the shower. I could feel the clay taking the oils out of my hair making it dry. Once in the shower I washed off the clay and applied the shampoo. (I usually shampoo my hair 2-3 times to remove all the excess oil since its so bad) With the L'oreal clay shampoo i only needed to shampoo once and my hair no longer felt greasy but a little dry since it took all my oils out. SO once the shampoo was completely washed out i applied the conditioner and left it on for about 5-10 minutes. Once washed off my hair felt so soft and was so shiny( also smelled amazing) ! I would def reccomend this to anyone whos hair is super oily and dry This review was collected as part of a promotion."

AVpfW8y_LJeJML437ySW,L'oreal Paris,"Beauty,Hair Care,Shampoo & Conditioner,Holiday Shop,Christmas,Featured Brands,Health & Beauty,L'oreal,Personal Care,Hair Treatments,Conditioner","I received this free from the L'Oral Influenster campaign for the purpose of an honest review. This conditioner, like the shampoo, is also formulated with three different types of clay to specifically target hair with oily roots and dry ends. The conditioner wasn't as thick as I was expecting, but it was still easy to spread throughout my hair and seemed to do a decent job of moisturizing and managing tangles without weighing everything down. I only condition from the middle of my hair down to avoid weighing my hair down at the roots. After rinsing it away, my hair was tangle-free and easy to brush through, and felt bouncy and hydrated. It styled easily and while my hair did seem a bit drier near the roots, it didn't get frizzy or unmanageable throughout the day. I consider that to be a win!

I went 4 full days without washing my hair. I cooked, cleaned, worked out and live in FL. On the 4th day, my hair was still decent, but my roots were beginning to get a bit shiny. I could have easily sprayed some dry shampoo in my roots and I really believe I could have went to 5 days without washing my hair (so gross, I know). The conditioner claims to hydrate ends and I can agree with that claim. When rinsing out the conditioner in the shower, my hair felt so soft. Throughout the 4 day span, my hair was not dry nor did it feel stripped. I received this complimentary product from Influenster to test out and all opinions are my own, but when I run out of this product, I would most definitely purchase. For 4.99, you can not beat it.

My hair is naturally very curly, color treated, it gets very oily on my roots and stays dry on my ends. This line has been a saving grace for my hair. It has helped to keep the oil under control in between washes, and my ends are starting to feel smoother, not as dry, and easier to maintain. On top of noticeable differences, the products are lasting me quite well. I have been using them 3-4 times a week, for almost a month, and I believe I have not even hit the half-way point on any of the products.

First, I applied the clay mask to my roots. I let this sit for about 5-10 minutes pre-shower. Once in the shower, I then rinsed it off. I continued with the shampoo, making sure to really scrub my roots. After, I applied the conditioner and let this sit for about 5 minutes in the shower. Once out, I towel dried my hair and let air dry. I'm not sure what effect blow drying or using heat tools would have after using this product. But, having let air dry, my hair was less wavy and tangled than normal. Not did my hair feel more silky, but it also looked more silky and healthy. Usually, I can only go one day without washing my hair however, after using this product/line together I was able to go two days. My roots were very voluminous after washing with these products and my scalp felt genuinely clean. It is definitely unlike any other shower hair products I have used. Aside from the clean feeling and volume, I also felt like my hair texture was silkier and would get tangled less frequently. My one con would be the smell during the shower, although I didn't notice it afterwards. However, my boyfriend commented that my hair smelled good after so this could just be my personal preferences. I will definitely be purchasing this again once I run out of the sponsored/complimentary samples I received. All the above thoughts are my own honest opinions.

After the 5 minutes I used the comb to clear my hair of any knots which by the way was very easy to remove thanks to this conditioner being so rich in texture. My hair was soo smooth and smelled amazinggg. When done removing knots i applied a small amount into my hair againg (something I just do with any conditioner) and then jut left it to air dry.

But this one was the opposite. My hair feels so soft and light and most of all really clean. I do recommend using it along with the mask and the shampoo. They all smell great and they will really help out with dry scalps. Thank me later. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

AVpfW8y_LJeJML437ySW,L'oreal Paris,"Beauty,Hair Care,Shampoo & Conditioner,Holiday Shop,Christmas,Featured Brands,Health & Beauty,L'oreal,Personal Care,Hair Treatments,Conditioner","This conditioner is part of the L'Oreal Extraordinary Clay hair care system (Mask, Shampoo, Conditioner) which is designed to treat the different requirements of an oily scalp and roots and dry ends. This balancing system of hair care is designed to break the cycle of combination hair. After shampoo, apply the conditioner to wet hair and massage it into hair from mid-length to ends. I let the conditioner sit on my hair for a couple of minutes, comb through and rinse as usual. This conditioner is light-weight and moisturizing allowing daily use, however using it with the other products in the Extraordinary Clay system will allow combination hair to stay fresh, soft and hydrated for up to 3 days. The packaging is an attractive green bottle which matches the colour design of the mask and shampoo in the system. I really like that L'Oreal designs the conditioner bottle to dispense the product from the opposite end. This helps to distinguish the shampoo and the conditioner bottles while I am in the shower. The product is white and creamy with a pleasant herbal scent. I have used this conditioner multiple times and have found that it coats the hair well, is easy to comb through the hair and rinses cleanly. My hair feels immediately moisturized without being greasy or oily. As a bonus, this conditioner is silicone-free. This product is effective to use on its own or as part of the Extraordinary Clay system and I feel that the conditioner, and the entire system, is a great value for the money.

When I have gotten the packeage my hair was already 2 days into a blow-dry so it was super oily and due for a wash. I appied the clay first to my roots and worked my way through. I left it in for 5 minutes and then hopped into the shower. I could feel the clay taking the oils out of my hair making it dry. Once in the shower I washed off the clay and applied the shampoo. (I usually shampoo my hair 2-3 times to remove all the excess oil since its so bad) With the L'oreal clay shampoo i only needed to shampoo once and my hair no longer felt greasy but a little dry since it took all my oils out. SO once the shampoo was completely washed out i applied the conditioner and left it on for about 5-10 minutes. Once washed off my hair felt so soft and was so shiny( also smelled amazing) !

I usually buy different kinds of conditioners since my husband likes to apply a little bit when washing his hair and even he approved!

I liked the way it felt, I didn't leave the product on my roots for a long period of time, but I did leave it for a little longer on my ends. I liked the way the product smelled and I felt like it was a premier product, luxurious and not weighted down. I used the whole system of pre-shampoo clay, the clay shampoo, and the clay conditioner. Although I did not notice much of a difference in oil control over the next 48 hours, my hair did definitely feel re-balanced, soft, and purified. I do not color my hair with dye, but I do get bleach foils and i did not experience any damage with this product.

I mean this is the last step to take to have FLAWLESS OIL FREE, BUT STILL HAVE NICE, SHINY, HYDRATED HAIR!! The first step in this trio is allowing the clay mask to sit and absorb all the impurities out of your roots. It suggested 5 minutes but I have OILY OILY hair so I did it for 10. Next you just rinse it off in the showe and then proceed to shampoo. Lastly you use the conditioner. For me, I would put the conditioner on my roots and work my way up so I have conditioner in my roots but not a whole bunch! Last but not least, enjoy your fabulous hair! Not only does it smell great, but you really can go 2 days without showering your hair! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

After using the clay mask and rinsing it out and shampooing my hair, I applied a small handful of conditioner on my hair focusing on the ends. It also had a great scent, I notice it stills has a light floral scent days after washing my hair. I recommend using the combination of the clay mask, shampoo and conditioner. However, I would not recommend using the clay mask every time you wash your hair but rather 1-2 times a month to remove oils.

I am particularly dependent upon conditioners as I am in the process of maintaining and continuing to grow my long hair, which is prone to dry, brittle ends with splitting issues. I have tried a few other products from L'Oreal that have helped combat my dry ends and this Clay conditioner is another stellar find. I really enjoy using the whole Clay system and find that my hair is noticeably softer and shinier after washing with this product.

After balayaging my hair and having to wash my hair every day due to working out and because I work in a hospital, my hair has been so dry, thin, and damaged on the ends but oily at the roots, that it seldom looked good. I had tried countless products, home remedies, and tried not washing it for a few days at a time (I know that most people do this, but I really can't because of my work or could potentially pass infection along to my patients). I received the clay mask, shampoo, and conditioner, and instantly became obsessed. My hair felt nourished, smooth, and clean from root to end. The amazing and subtle smell lasted 48 hours in my hair. I've mentioned this product to so many people, including my coworkers, and have made my friends try it. I love this product and highly encourage other people to use it.

I received the clay hair mask, the shampoo and the conditioner. I was very skeptical about this since I am picky of what I put in my hair. I used the mask first it didn't smell the best but thats not the purpose of the product. My hair gets very oily and this product was going to help take the some of the excess oil out. I left the clay mask on for 5 min then jumped in the shower to wash out like it said in the directing. So far I didnt feel much of a difference so I added the shampoo to my wet hair after all the mask was out. I noticed my hair felt lighter. I shampoo smelled a lot better than the mask and made my hair feel a bit softer too. Lastly i applied the conditioner and it definitely changed my mind on using these products. Once my hair was dry and I combed through it felt lighter, not oily and felt like i had just gotten my hair washed by the salon. My hair and head felt refreshed.

This conditioner, like the shampoo, is also formulated with three different types of clay to specifically target hair with oily roots and dry ends. The conditioner wasn't as thick as I was expecting, but it was still easy to spread throughout my hair and seemed to do a decent job of moisturizing and managing tangles without weighing everything down. I only condition from the middle of my hair down to avoid weighing my hair down at the roots. After rinsing it away, my hair was tangle-free and easy to brush through, and felt bouncy and hydrated. It styled easily and while my hair did seem a bit drier near the roots, it didn't get frizzy or unmanageable throughout the day. I consider that to be a win!

The conditioner wasn't as thick as I was expecting, but it was still easy to spread throughout my hair and seemed to do a decent job of moisturizing and managing tangles without weighing everything down. I only condition from the middle of my hair down to avoid weighing my hair down at the roots. After rinsing it away, my hair was tangle-free and easy to brush through, and felt bouncy and hydrated. It styled easily and while my hair did seem a bit drier near the roots, it didn't get frizzy or unmanageable throughout the day. I consider that to be a win!

Conditioner: I really liked this product. I usually have to use a huge amount of conditioner and I typically use a really thick one as well because my hair loves to tangle. This conditioner isn't super thick but it's a good consistency. I was surprised at how well it actually did de-tangle my hair without having to use half the bottle! Again, this just has a light clean smell, nothing too strong. After wash and drying I felt like my hair didn't have any product build up. It helped me with my typical oily roots and left my hair feeling soft and refreshed. I was able to go a longer stretch of time without washing my hair which is always a plus! Overall I would definitely recommend this product to other people. Especially people who feel like they have oily hair or a lot of product build up.

I often have problems with my hair getting oily very soon after I wash it, this is a big problem for me especially in the winter when I don't want to wash it as often since it gets more dry/brittle in the cold weather. I used this conditioner along with the shampoo and pre-shampoo mask as directed on the packaging. By the end of the first day my hair was still oil free. By the end of day two I was convinced. My hair had started to get oily again but not anywhere near what it would have been using my normal shampoo/conditioner routine.

I'm not the hugest fan of the scent of this product, but it's not super overpowering and doesn't linger for very long, so it's definitely tolerable. The conditioner is very lightweight and I don't feel like it adds additional weight/oil to my hair, but I still feel like it hydrates my ends very well.

This Voxbox was perfect for me since I have combination hair, oily roots and dry ends. Dry shampoo is my holy grail product, but I do like changing up my hair routine. This unique system by LOreal has three refined clays to purify and remove oil from your scalp and hair. Lately, clay masks for the face have been one of the biggest beauty trends, but what happens when we apply it to our scalp to get rid of oil. Treat yourself to a mini spa session and give your hair some TLC. Give yourself a head massage while applying the mask and then wash it all away with warm water. The conditioner smells very similar, and it has a creamy consistency. It applies very smoothly, I let it soak in for about 5 minutes. After drying my hair, and using only heat protectant spray, my hair felt so soft and moisturized, it had a natural shine and my tips did not feel brittle.

I was hesitant at first because I have really long hair and a lot of it. I go through conditioner regularly. I condition my hair A LOT!! I used the Extraordinary Clay Mask first - and then the Extraordinary Clay Shampoo to rinse out the mask and then applied the conditioner. I put my normal amount of conditioner in my hand and immediately found out I did not need as much of this conditioner. It worked well and needed less product. I use the mask once a week. In between I use just the shampoo and conditioner. Still I didn't need as much of this conditioner! I love it!! The scent is nice and fresh as well. This review was collected as part of a promotion.

Same as the shampoo it comes in the pretty mint green, very pretty packaging I do love that in products. Plus for me. Ok so after the rich lather and rinse of the shampoo my scalp is feeling refreshed, clean, and I reach for the conditioner. I dispense, and smell, same clean fragrance I know and love at this point. Apply to my ends it feels so silky and soft. I always leave my conditioner on for at least a minute to sit, so rinsing was so nice I could already feel the softness of my hair, I couldn't wait to see how this all turned out. After drying I'm mind blown. My scalp is rejuvenated while my hair is so clean, fresh, and smells amazing. My ends are pure silk, and I'm highly impressed! Everyone's hair is different, but this just works! I've tried and spent so much money on hair care, I've finally found my routine. Mask, shampoo/conditioner. I have to say this was a great experience, the clay is all so new to me but it works! I've never been able to skip a hair wash but now I can take better care of my hair with this line of extraordinary clay. My oily roots are non existent while my hair is fresh, lightweight, and hydrated. It's everything we've been looking for. I highly recommend giving this a try, that magical mint green is a total game changer! It's different, innovative, and just works!!

I never washed my hair daily but usually every other day and sometimes every 3 days depending on what I was doing and how I wore my hair but with this line from L'Oral I can now easily go 3 days between washs with no need for dry shampoo and sometimes even 4 days! Think about that for a minute... 4 days between having to wash your hair! It's a huge time saver and has made my morning routine so much less rushed by making it so I'm only washing my hair 1-2 times per week! Plus you can't beat the price!

I'll keep using it! My comments are similar to my review of the shampoo, in that it works, smells fine, and makes my hair look good. I'm also impressed with the use of the clays as a more innovative approach to address hair concerns. I received this product complimentary from Influenster to review for my honest opinion.

AVpfW8y_LJeJML437ySW,L'oreal Paris,"Beauty,Hair Care,Shampoo & Conditioner,Holiday Shop,Christmas,Featured Brands,Health & Beauty,L'oreal,Personal Care,Hair Treatments,Conditioner","I received this product for free in exchange for a review. I have hair that becomes fairly oily after just a couple days, but is also dry and frizzy. While the pre-shampoo treatment soaked up extra oil and the shampoo really cleaned my scalp, the conditioner made sure my hair was super soft and hydrated. It was also very easy to manage, which is awesome because my hair usually becomes tangled fairly easily even though I have fine, straight hair. They advertise the 48 hours on the bottle and I thought my hair still looked freshly cleaned after a couple days, so I was pretty happy with it. I'm sure you could go even longer with the dry shampoo, which I may have to try! This review was collected as part of a promotion."

AVpfW8y_LJeJML437ySW,L'oreal Paris,"Beauty,Hair Care,Shampoo & Conditioner,Holiday Shop,Christmas,Featured Brands,Health & Beauty,L'oreal,Personal Care,Hair Treatments,Conditioner","I have been using this L'Oral conditioner for a short time and love it. I usually apply it after the shampoo and only from the middle of the hair to the tips, and it is impressive that after only one applied, my hair felt much more hydrated, the tips were not so dry and the hair in general was much softer and manageable. This conditioner completely amazed me and has become must have in my hair care. What I should mention is that the smell is a bit strong and lasts a long time in the hair after washing it, so if you are not very fond of menthol or herbal scents, it may be a little annoying for you, The particular does not bother me much. 5 stars for this conditioner because it deserves it, and 100 recommended.

I gave this and the shampoo a fair shot, and they did a very good job and cleaning my oily scalp. I have color treated ends that always look dry the conditioner helped with the texture and appearance. The shampoo is what I feel does all the cleaning. I do think I'll repurchase once I run out, so far I'm liking my results! I have the hair mask in this line 3 stars bc it only helped with the oily roots aspect of the line and also I'm not much of a mask person. So if you have oily roots and dry ends, I'd recommend checking out the shampoo and conditioner from this line.

I went 4 full days without washing my hair. I cooked, cleaned, worked out and live in FL. On the 4th day, my hair was still decent, but my roots were beginning to get a bit shiny. I could have easily sprayed some dry shampoo in my roots and I really believe I could have went to 5 days without washing my hair (so gross, I know). The conditioner claims to hydrate ends and I can agree with that claim. When rinsing out the conditioner in the shower, my hair felt so soft. Throughout the 4 day span, my hair was not dry nor did it feel stripped.

When I use it, I place the clay mask as directed, use the shampoo and conditioner as directed. I style my hair like I normally would (but for testing purposes I didn't use hair spray or any other styling product). The next day my hair wasn't greasy, as it usually is!

AVpfW8y_LJeJML437ySW,L'oreal Paris,"Beauty,Hair Care,Shampoo & Conditioner,Holiday Shop,Christmas,Featured Brands,Health & Beauty,L'oreal,Personal Care,Hair Treatments,Conditioner","This is a nice conditioner that leaves my hair feeling silky smooth and nice. I have normal hair type, which is highlighted. I was skeptical about the claim regarding the clay -- Clay is usually used on the skin such as in a facial mask it absorbs a lot of oil and in this use the label states it is supposed to ansorb the excess oil on your scalp in order to help an oily scalp. I was concerned if this would dry out the skin on my scalp and therefore lead to flaking dandruff but this has not happened. This product is advertised to have no silicone, for people who are trying to avoid silicone products due to health threats. My regular conditioning product is by Sukin in which is all natural and uses essential oils for scent (which is lightly scented). In comparison this L'Oreal product is very highly scented to a point where once I use it my whole shower smells of it, it masks over the scent of my fragranced soap, it seems to emit while I'm blow-drying my hair and I can smell the scent in my hair all day i received these products free/complimentary for testing purposes, but all opinions are your own.

But, I am an influenster and willing to try new things. I have to say I was skeptical. I was afraid my hair would turn out greasier than normal. After the first use I was a little more greasier. BUT, the second time I was so amazed. My hair was soft, very smooth, shiny, smelled wonderful, and my hair wasn't as greasy the next morning!! I'm obsessed with using conditioner, and this is by far my favorite. I tend to mix shampoo and conditioner brands. This one is best to use with the Extraordinary Clay shampoo, as any brand would recommend, but this leaves my hair so easy to rinse and clean.

My hair is naturally very curly, color treated, it gets very oily on my roots and stays dry on my ends. This line has been a saving grace for my hair. It has helped to keep the oil under control in between washes, and my ends are starting to feel smoother, not as dry, and easier to maintain. On top of noticeable differences, the products are lasting me quite well. I have been using them 3-4 times a week, for almost a month, and I believe I have not even hit the half-way point on any of the products.

Since then my color has faded but I did receive this to try and decided to give it a go. I can't comment on how it would work on color treated hair (whether it would fade or not) but I was very impressed with how it works on oily hair! I have the clay mask and the shampoo as well. Using them together my hair lasted 3 full days without being greasy. Personally my hair gets pretty oily and after a day and a half I usually need to wash it so this was really impressive to me.

I am a male with thinning hair and now a days suffering from dry scalp. I have used this conditioner few times till now.

Tea tree in other products has always been a bit too intense, and with a small bathroom I found it hard to breathe using other conditioners.

It consists of Nizoral AD, Regenepure DR/NT, Head Shoulders Classic, and Selsun Blue, alternated (not all at the same time). These shampoos help fight fungal over growths that cause sebhorreic dermatitis, malasezzia folliculitus, and dandruff. However, they really dry out your skin and hair. For the latter, this conditioner brings my hair back to life. And, the tea tree oil is a known antiseptic that also helps fight the aforementioned conditions, which is icing on the cake.The only thing I don't like about it, is that it seems I have to use quite a bit on my thick, medium length hair. I may go through this bottle quicker than I'd like, and it's relatively expensive compared to cheap stuff. We'll see how I fare in the long run, hopefully I find I don't need as much as I am using."

I just condition my ends with it on special occasions. The smell from the bottle is unbelievably strong, no matter how much I rinse, they scent stays. Also, If you have a sensitive scalp, I would recommend keeping this away from your scalp as it makes my scalp very itchy. I would use it daily if it didn't smell so bad. I don't understand why manufacturers put any fragrance in their products anyway. It is a very thick, artificial sort of smell. I wish they made a low chemical, fragrance free version I could use daily."

It looks like I dyed my hair again after using it!!! I'm bleach blonde with long dry hair. This left my hair feeling soft and nourished, and it made my hair look shiny, vibrant and repaired! I first used the color vibrancy mask on dry hair, covered it with plastic and let it sit for about 10 minutes. For the last 2 minutes I ran a blow dryer on the hottest setting over my hair. I then showered. I rinsed the mask off then applied the shampoo only to my roots and washed out after no more than a minute. I then used the conditioner and let it sit for the remainder of my shower before rinsing. This also has a great strawberry smell that lasts. I can't believe how much blonder and shinier my hair is after just one use! I received these products free/complimentary for testing purposes in my first VoxBox, but all opinions my own.

They have a great smell, which helps easing the strong smell of the coloring products. 2. The color on the hair doesn't look fake. 3. Hair looks shiny bright!! 4. Very easy to comb, soft, silky hair.

With that out of the way, I feel like the formula is not very consistent. Even though it looks like I use the same amount every time I shower, sometimes as I apply the conditioner it feels like I didn't put very much in, and other times it feels fine. I have a lot of split ends and breakage from growing my hair out, and I don't find that my hair breaks any less. Many times my hair gets really static-y after it dries; one would think static would be reduced because hair is ""nourished"" and conditioned. I also don't find the scent of the conditioner to be all that pleasant."

It is by far the best conditioner I've tried, it makes my hair so smooth, shiny and soft without greasiness (And my hair is a long pixie!) It really moisturizes the dry stubborn areas of my hair unlike many conditioners out there. Plus the scent is delicious! Smells like a salon product.I use this without the shampoo though, cause using both my hair gets very greasy and weighed down (The shampoo is the culprit)"
AVphkL3nilAPnD_x64AU,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Beauty","As someone who is very wary of Shampoos and Conditioners with Silicones and Sulfates in them, I was excited to see this. However, after I bought it I looked at the ingredients I found that this shampoo contains Dimethiconol...a non-water soluble SILICONE. So needless to say I won't be buying this shampoo anymore."
AVphkL3nilAPnD_x64AU,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Beauty","The bottle for this product is amazing, and it smells great too, rids of the oils. But the actual product strips and dries your hair of its natural shine. Do not use daily unless you want straw like hair."

AVphkL3nilAPnD_x64AU,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Beauty","I used this product a couple years ago, I have compliments about how shiny and sleeky my hair was, (I never asked anyone if they noticed any difference on my hair, they just noticed it). However, my hair had bad tangle, I lost a lot of hair just running my fingers through the hair, it tangled a lot at the ends. So I stopped using it, and I don't have this issue with other Pantene's shampoo."
AVphkL3nilAPnD_x64AU,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Beauty","This and Aqualight (discontinued) used to be my favorite shampoos. My fine hair would come out nice and clean, but not coated or dry. However, when I was at the store today I noticed that they changed the scent of the whole line, including this one. It's like a perfume-y, sweet, fake strawberry infused scent. I do not like it at all. Pantene, please change it back!"

Local store ran out of it well over a year ago so I only use what I had left for special occasions this past year. I've been swimming in chlorinated pool for 3 years without a cap and this plus the Ice conditioner kept my straight hair soft and looking great and even got compliments on its shine. Glad to find it again.

I have been searching for this shampoo for at least 6 months now because it is no longer carried in Walmart and I love how my hair feels and shines after using it. The shampoo itself is great, I get lots of compliments from other ladies when I am seen out an about. As for buying it thru Walmart.com, I had no problem. The site is easy to use and understand. The only thing that would be easier is if the Walmart store still carried the shampoo on its shelves. Other than that I will have to continue to use Walmart.com to buy this item and any others that the store stops carrying that I still prefer to use."

AVphkL3nilAPnD_x64AU,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Beauty",This product I have been using for years! I love how it makes my hair feel and look! It's a drug store shampoo that just works the best for my hair. But the only thing I hate is how hard it is to find it in ANY store!
AVphkL3nilAPnD_x64AU,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Beauty",I love this shampoo. I mix it with Smooth and Sleek Conditioner. The combination of the two builds up on my hair to improve it so substantially that there is truly nothing like it. Today my stylist asked me what I used. I told him I use Pantene. He dropped his jaw. He even showed another stylist !
AVphkL3nilAPnD_x64AU,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Beauty",I have gray/white hair. I have been using Ice shine for years. It really makes my hair nice and shiny especially in the sunshine. I get lots of compliments. I don't get the dull yellow color I used to have. Even my stylist likes the shine. My problem now is it is hard to find in the stores.
AVphkL3nilAPnD_x64AU,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Beauty",I have a very oily scalp that needs to be shampooed daily and wanted a clarifying shampoo. My hair and scalp feel very clean using this shampoo and the extra shiny hair is a plus. The only thing is that this makes my roots look so shiny it by default looks oily to me even though it's clean. If you have dull hair or just want it to feel extra clean I would definitely try this. The conditioner is even better.
AVphkL3nilAPnD_x64AU,Pantene,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Shampoo,Shampoos,Beauty","I was extremely disappointed when Pantene discontinued this shampoo a few years ago, and thrilled when they brought it back. This product really delivers as promised-- clean, SHINY, healthy-looking hair. I've tried other products, and nothing I've tried has compared. I hope this shampoo is now a permanent member of the Pantene product lineup!"

AVpiVCpSLJeJML43kn-a,Organic Root Stimulator,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Shaving,Aftershaves,Skin Care,Beauty,Facial Treatments",Due to the design of the opening when squeezed usually too much is released. An improved design of the opening that would better control the flow of the oil would be very convenient. Which is the reason for only 4 stars.
AVpiymgALJeJML43pGyd,Ogx,"Personal Care,Hair Care,Conditioner,Conditioners,Health & Beauty,Hair Care & Styling,Shampoos & Conditioners,Beauty","I am not sure if it's the wonderful smell or the lightening power in this conditioner that is so wonderful. In the cold snowy winter my blond hair can get really dark so I have been looking for a product that can stand strong in the fight with me. Other lightening products have made my hair yellow, but you can really feel the quality in this. The result is a very natural subtle lightening/ highlighted look. You need to give this a try. The only thing I am not thrilled about is it really doesn't do a great job of detangling my hair... But I have curly hair so that's a whole different task in itself.

This is the best product I do not recommend this for every day washing because frequently using this will make your wet hair feel dry but that is the only thing... When your hair dries you can see the difference asap. Buy this and you will be happy!
